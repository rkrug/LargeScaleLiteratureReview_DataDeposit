  abstract = {Dioecy (i.e. having separate sexes) is a rather rare breeding system in flowering plants. Such rareness may result from a high probability of extinction in dioecious species because of less efficient dispersal and the costs of sexual selection, which are expected to harm dioecious species' survival on the long term. These handicaps should decrease the effective population size (Ne) of dioecious species, which in turn should reduce the efficacy of selection. Moreover, sexual selection in dioecious species is expected to specifically affect some genes, which will evolve under positive selection. The relative contribution of these effects is currently unknown and we tried to disentangle them by comparing sequence evolution between dioecious and non-dioecious species in the Silene genus (Caryophyllaceae), where dioecy has evolved at least twice. For the dioecious species in the section Melandrium, where dioecy is the oldest, we found a global reduction of purifying selection, while on some, male-biased genes, positive selection was found. For section Otites, where dioecy evolved more recently, we found no significant differences between dioecious and non-dioecious species. Our results are consistent with the view that dioecy is an evolutionary dead end in flowering plants, although other scenarios for explaining reduced Ne cannot be ruled out. Our results also show that contrasting forces act on the genomes of dioecious plants, and suggest that some time is required before the genome of such plants bears the footprints of dioecy. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2012 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.},

  abstract = {Understanding how disturbance shapes the dynamics of ecological systems is of fundamental importance in ecology. One emerging approach to revealing and appreciating disturbance effects involves examining disturbance-driven changes in the variability of ecological responses. Variability is rarely employed as a response variable to assess the influence of disturbance, but recent studies indicate that it can be an extremely sensitive metric, capturing differences obscured by averaging and conveying important ecological information about underlying causal processes. In this paper, we present a conceptual model to understand and predict the effects of disturbance on variability. The model estimates qualitative changes in variability by considering disturbance extent, frequency and intensity, as well as ecosystem recovery, and thereby captures not only the immediate effects of disturbance but also those that arise over time due to the biotic response to an event. We evaluate how well the model performs by comparing predictions with empirical results from studies examining a wide variety of disturbances and ecosystems, and discuss factors that may modify or even confound predictions. We include a concise guide to characterizing and detecting changes in variability, highlighting the most common and easily applied methods and conclude by describing several future directions for research. By considering variability as a response to disturbance, we gain another metric of fundamental system behaviour, an improved ability to identify organizing features of ecosystems and a better understanding of the predictability of disturbance-driven change \textendash{} all critical aspects of assessing ecosystem response to disturbance.},

  abstract = {China's forest cover has been increasing in the past three decades, which is in sharp contrast to rapid declines in other natural resources. Understanding the mechanisms of forest recovery and their effects is essential for sustaining forests in China and elsewhere. Some studies suggest that imports of forest products have contributed to the increase in forest cover of China and the decline in forest cover of exporting countries. However, it is not clear whether other countries beyond the exporting countries are affected. Using the framework of telecoupling (socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances), we found that China's forest cover increase is affected by multiple telecoupling processes (e.g. trade of food and forest products) and their interactions with each other and with other factors. The socioeconomic and environmental impacts of telecoupling processes go well beyond China and the exporting countries. As China's demand for forest products and other ecosystem services such as food and water continues to rise, telecouplings will become even more important for sustainable forests, food security, water security, human well-being and environmental sustainability in the future. New and more effective policies are needed to minimise negative and enhance positive impacts of telecouplings on China and other countries around the world.},

  volume = {9},
  doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0106268},
  abstract = {Genetic differentiation can be promoted allopatrically by geographic isolation of populations due to limited dispersal ability and diversification over time or sympatrically through, for example, host-race formation. In crop pests, the trading of crops across the world can lead to intermixing of genetically distinct pest populations. However, our understanding of the importance of allopatric and sympatric genetic differentiation in the face of anthropogenic genetic intermixing is limited. Here, we examined global sequence variation in two mitochondrial and one nuclear genes in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus that uses different legumes as hosts. We analyzed 180 samples from 42 populations of this stored bean pest from tropical and subtropical continents and archipelagos: Africa, the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia, Oceania and South America. For the mitochondrial genes, there was weak but significant genetic differentiation across continents/archipelagos. Further, we found pronounced differentiation among subregions within continents/archipelagos both globally and within Africa but not within Asia. We suggest that multiple introductions into Asia and subsequent intermixing within Asia have generated this pattern. The isolation by distance hypothesis was supported globally (with or without continents controlled) but not when host species was restricted to cowpeas Vigna unguiculata, the ancestral host of C. maculatus. We also document significant among-host differentiation both globally and within Asia, but not within Africa. We failed to reject a scenario of a constant population size in the recent past combined with selective neutrality for the mitochondrial genes. We conclude that mitochondrial DNA differentiation is primarily due to geographic isolation within Africa and to multiple invasions by different alleles, followed by host shifts, within Asia. The weak inter-continental differentiation is most likely due to frequent inter-continental gene flow mediated by human crop trade. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2014 Tuda et al.},

  abstract = {Multiple dynamics and uncertainties are involved in regional energy and greenhouse gas management (REGM) system, confronting decision makers during plan/policy makings. In this study, a greenhouse gas (GHG)-mitigation oriented inexact dynamic energy system management model (IFMP-REGM) is developed for a REGM system. The IFMP-REGM is a hybrid methodology of interval mathematical programming, fuzzy linear programming and multi-stage stochastic programming. It can not only handle uncertainties presented as discrete intervals, fuzzy sets and probability distributions, but also reflect dynamic variations of system conditions, particularly for large-scale multistage problems with sequential structures. The uncertain information can be incorporated within a multi-layer scenario tree; revised decisions are permitted in each time period based on the realized values of the uncertain events. The developed IFMP-REGM model was then applied to a hypothetical regional energy and GHG management system. The results indicate that the IFMP-REGM can effectively address complexities of various system uncertainties as well as dealing with multi-stage stochastic decision problems within energy systems. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Are tropical forests a net source or net sink of atmospheric carbon dioxide? As fundamental a question as that is, there still is no agreement about the answer, with different studies suggesting that it is anything from a sizable sink to a modest source. Baccini et al. used 12 years of MODIS satellite data to determine how the aboveground carbon density of woody, live vegetation has changed throughout the entire tropics on an annual basis. They find that the tropics are a net carbon source, with losses owing to deforestation and reductions in carbon density within standing forests being double that of gains resulting from forest growth.Science, this issue p. 230The carbon balance of tropical ecosystems remains uncertain, with top-down atmospheric studies suggesting an overall sink and bottom-up ecological approaches indicating a modest net source. Here we use 12 years (2003 to 2014) of MODIS pantropical satellite data to quantify net annual changes in the aboveground carbon density of tropical woody live vegetation, providing direct, measurement-based evidence that the world's tropical forests are a net carbon source of 425.2 $\pm$ 92.0 teragrams of carbon per year (Tg C year\textendash{}1). This net release of carbon consists of losses of 861.7 $\pm$ 80.2 Tg C year\textendash{}1 and gains of 436.5 $\pm$ 31.0 Tg C year\textendash{}1. Gains result from forest growth; losses result from deforestation and from reductions in carbon density within standing forests (degradation or disturbance), with the latter accounting for 68.9\% of overall losses.},

  abstract = {Carbon storage by many terrestrial ecosystems can be limited by nutrients, predominantly nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), in addition to other environmental constraints, water, light and temperature. However the spatial distribution and the extent of both N and P limitation at the global scale have not been quantified. Here we have developed a global model of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycles for the terrestrial biosphere. Model estimates of steady state C and N pool sizes and major fluxes between plant, litter and soil pools, under present climate conditions, agree well with various independent estimates. The total amount of C in the terrestrial biosphere is 2767 Gt C, and the C fractions in plant, litter and soil organic matter are 19\%, 4\% and 77\%. The total amount of N is 135 Gt N, with about 94\% stored in the soil, 5\% in the plant live biomass, and 1\% in litter. We found that the estimates of total soil P and its partitioning into different pools in soil are quite sensitive to biochemical P mineralization. The total amount of P (plant biomass, litter and soil) excluding occluded P in soil is 17 Gt P in the terrestrial biosphere, 33\% of which is stored in the soil organic matter if biochemical P mineralization is modelled, or 31 Gt P with 67\% in soil organic matter otherwise. This model was used to derive the global distribution and uncertainty of N or P limitation on the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems at steady state under present conditions. Our model estimates that the net primary productivity of most tropical evergreen broadleaf forests and tropical savannahs is reduced by about 20\% on average by P limitation, and most of the remaining biomes are N limited; N limitation is strongest in high latitude deciduous needle leaf forests, and reduces its net primary productivity by up to 40\% under present conditions.},

  abstract = {Urban expansion often occurs on croplands. However, there is little scientific understanding of how global patterns of future urban expansion will affect the world's cultivated areas. Here, we combine spatially explicit projections of urban expansion with datasets on global croplands and crop yields. Our results show that urban expansion will result in a 1.8-2.4\% loss of global croplands by 2030, with substantial regional disparities. About 80\% of global cropland loss from urban expansion will take place in Asia and Africa. In both Asia and Africa, much of the cropland that will be lost is more than twice as productive as national averages. Asia will experience the highest absolute loss in cropland, whereas African countries will experience the highest percentage loss of cropland. Globally, the croplands that are likely to be lost were responsible for 3-4\% of worldwide crop production in 2000. Urban expansion is expected to take place on cropland that is 1.77 times more productive than the global average. The loss of cropland is likely to be accompanied by other sustainability risks and threatens livelihoods, with diverging characteristics for different megaurban regions. Governance of urban area expansion thus emerges as a key area for securing livelihoods in the agrarian economies of the Global South.},

  abstract = {The satellite based passive (radiometer) and active (radar) microwave sensors enhanced our ability to retrieve soil moisture at global scales. It has been almost four decades since the first passive microwave satellite sensor was launched in 1978. Since then soil moisture has gained considerable attention in hydro-meteorological, climate, and agricultural research resulting in the deployment of two dedicated missions in the last decade, SMOS and SMAP. Microwave retrievals require an algorithm to estimate soil moisture from satellite measurements. In this Part 1 of a two-part review series, we provide a synthesis of four decades of research and development on the passive and active microwave soil moisture retrieval algorithms. The algorithms associated with passive sensors use the radiometer brightness temperatures, while active sensors use the radar backscatter measurements to retrieve soil moisture. The physics of both algorithm classes are based on the fact that the microwave measurements at lower frequencies are influenced by the soil dielectric property, which acts as a proxy for the surface soil moisture content. In this review effort, the emphasis is laid on the physical models of the passive and the active retrieval algorithms. These algorithms facilitate to obtain the individual radiative contributions from soil, vegetation, and atmosphere that reach satellite sensors after mixing (roughness), scattering, and attenuation. In the process, we looked into the current research efforts to improve individual aspects of the algorithms, followed by a description of different retrieval procedures. In Part 2 of this review series, performance evaluation and inter-sensor comparisons of soil moisture of eight passive and two active sensors are carried out using 1058 stations along with model soil moisture data in the Contiguous United States (CONUS) region.},

  abstract = {Typhoon-generated storm waves generally cause mechanical damage to coral communities on present-day reefs, and the magnitude and extent of damage is predicted to increase in the near future as a result of global warming. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of potential future scenarios of reef ecosystems is of prime interest. This study assesses the current status of coral communities on Ibaruma reef, Ryukyu Islands, on the basis of field observations, engineering and fluid dynamic models, and calculations of wave motion, and predicts the potential effects of a super-extreme typhoon (incident wave height, H = 20 m; wave period, T = 20 s) on the reef. On the present-day reef, massive corals occur in shallow lagoons and tabular corals occur from the reef crest to the reef slope. The observed distribution of corals, which is frequently attacked by moderate (H = 10 m, T = 10 s) and extreme (H = 10 m, T = 15 s) typhoons, is consistent with the predictions of engineering models. Moreover, this study indicates that if a super-extreme typhoon attacks the reef in the near future, massive corals will survive in the shallow lagoons but tabular corals on the reef crest and reef slope will be severely impacted. The findings imply that super-extreme typhoons will cause a loss of species diversity, as the tabular corals are important reef builders and are critical to the maintenance of reef ecosystems. Consequently, reef restoration is a key approach to maintaining reef ecosystems in the wake of super-extreme typhoons.},

  abstract = {Temperature sensitivity of soil respiration (Q10) is an important parameter in modeling the effects of global warming on ecosystem carbon release. Experimental studies of soil respiration have ubiquitously indicated that Q10 has high spatial heterogeneity. However, most biogeochemical models still use a constant Q10 in projecting future climate change and no spatial pattern of Q10 values at large scales has been derived. In this study, we conducted an inverse modeling analysis to retrieve the spatial pattern of Q10 in China at 8 km spatial resolution by assimilating data of soil organic carbon into a process-based terrestrial carbon model (CASA model). The results indicate that the optimized Q10 values are spatially heterogeneous and consistent to the values derived from soil respiration observations. The mean Q10 values of different soil types range from 1.09 to 2.38, with the highest value in volcanic soil, and the lowest value in cold brown calcic soil. The spatial pattern of Q10 is related to environmental factors, especially precipitation and top soil organic carbon content. This study demonstrates that inverse modeling is a useful tool in deriving the spatial pattern of Q10 at large scales, with which being incorporated into biogeochemical models, uncertainty in the projection of future carbon dynamics could be potentially reduced. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2009 Science in China Press and Springer Berlin Heidelberg.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.foreco.2007.08.031},
  abstract = {The larch (Larix) genus is the most important species group in the forest ecosystems in Northeastern China, occupying about 25\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of the forest areas. The high tolerance to coldness and relatively fast growth rate make this genus the main species group for forestation. According to the predictions of the global circulation model CGCM3, temperature could rise by 2-4 degrees C over the next 100 years. Few studies have been conducted on the response of larch species to climate warming in Northeastern China. Such studies are becoming increasingly needed due to the economic and ecological significance of this genus. This paper studies the potential distribution ranges of three larch species under the current and the warming climate conditions. A new classification and regression tree technique, Random Forest, was used to investigate the potential distributions of three larch species, based on 18 environmental variables which reflect the climate, topography and soil conditions of Northeastern China. The results showed that the biological coldness index (BCI) is the most important factor for Dahurian larch, annual precipitation (AP) is the most important factor for Korean larch and elevation (DEM) is the most important factor for Prince Rupprecht larch. Under the current climate regime, in general, the prediction accuracy for the training dataset is much higher than that of testing dataset. The prediction accuracy for Dahurian larch is much higher than that of other two larch species. Under three climate warming scenarios, the southeast boundary of suitable habitat of Dahurian Larch was modeled to retreat northwestward by 90 km (CGCM3-B1) via 105 km (CGCM3-Al B) to 140 km (CGCM3-A2) scenario. The potential area would thus decrease from 25.5 million ha currently to 13, 9.5 and 7.2 million ha, correspondingly. The northwest boundary of suitable habitat for Korean larch was modeled move northwestward by 100 km (CGCM3-B 1) via 125 km (CGCM3-A1B) to 340 krn (CGCM3-A2), while the southern boundary may move northeastward 125 km via 170-200 km, respectively. The modeled potential area thus decreased from 14.6 million ha to 14.5, 12.6 and 9.7 million ha, correspondingly. The suitable habitat of Prince Rupprecht Larch was modeled to disappear under each of the three scenarios. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {By 2050, the world population is likely to be 9.1 billion, the CO(2) concentration 550 ppm, the ozone concentration 60 ppb and the climate warmer by ca 2 degrees C. In these conditions, what contribution can increased crop yield make to feeding the world? CO(2) enrichment is likely to increase yields of most crops by approximately 13 per cent but leave yields of C4 crops unchanged. It will tend to reduce water consumption by all crops, but this effect will be approximately cancelled out by the effect of the increased temperature on evaporation rates. In many places increased temperature will provide opportunities to manipulate agronomy to improve crop performance. Ozone concentration increases will decrease yields by 5 per cent or more. Plant breeders will probably be able to increase yields considerably in the CO(2)-enriched environment of the future, and most weeds and airborne pests and diseases should remain controllable, so long as policy changes do not remove too many types of crop-protection chemicals. However, soil-borne pathogens are likely to be an increasing problem when warmer weather will increase their multiplication rates; control is likely to need a transgenic approach to breeding for resistance. There is a large gap between achievable yields and those delivered by farmers, even in the most efficient agricultural systems. A gap is inevitable, but there are large differences between farmers, even between those who have used the same resources. If this gap is closed and accompanied by improvements in potential yields then there is a good prospect that crop production will increase by approximately 50 per cent or more by 2050 without extra land. However, the demands for land to produce bio-energy have not been factored into these calculations.},

Yet the inclusion of forests in international climate agreements has been complex, often considered a secondary mitigation option. In the context of the Paris Climate Agreement, countries submitted their (Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions ((I) NDCs), including climate mitigation targets. Assuming full implementation of (I) NDCs, we show that land use, and forests in particular, emerge as a key component of the Paris Agreement: turning globally from a net anthropogenic source during 1990-2010 (1.3 +/- 1.1 GtCO(2)e yr(-1)) to a net sink of carbon by 2030 (up to 1.1 +/- 0.5 GtCO(2)e yr(-1)), and providing a quarter of emission reductions planned by countries. Realizing and tracking this mitigation potential requires more transparency in countries' pledges and enhanced science-policy cooperation to increase confidence in numbers, including reconciling the approximate to 3 GtCO(2)e yr(-1) difference in estimates between country reports and scientific studies.},

Our ability to accurately simulate drought-induced forest impacts remains highly uncertain in part owing to our failure to integrate physiological measurements, regional-scale models, and dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). Here we show consistent predictions of widespread mortality of needleleaf evergreen trees (NET) within Southwest USA by 2100 using state-of-the-art models evaluated against empirical data sets. Experimentally, dominant Southwest USA NET species died when they fell below predawn water potential (pd) thresholds (April-August mean) beyond which photosynthesis, hydraulic and stomatal conductance, and carbohydrate availability approached zero. The evaluated regional models accurately predicted NET pd, and 91\% of predictions (10 out of 11) exceeded mortality thresholds within the twenty-first century due to temperature rise. The independent DGVMs predicted $\geq$50\% loss of Northern Hemisphere NET by 2100, consistent with the NET findings for Southwest USA. Notably, the global models underestimated future mortality within Southwest USA, highlighting that predictions of future mortality within global models may be underestimates. Taken together, the validated regional predictions and the global simulations predict widespread conifer loss in coming decades under projected global warming.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dietary shift from indigenous and traditional plants (ITPs) to cash crops and exotic plant food sources increases the risk of malnutrition and other nutrition-related non-communicable diseases, especially in poor rural communities. Farm communities in South Africa have been associated with poor nutritional status and extreme poverty. ITPs have been found to be affordable sources of several micronutrients. However, knowledge of and the use of these plants are declining, and little is known about the child's acceptance of dishes prepared with ITPs. This knowledge can be used to improve the general acceptance of ITPs. This study aimed to gain insight into parents' knowledge and perceptions and their use of ITPs in a farming community in the North West Province and to assess children's acceptance of and preference for dishes made with African leafy vegetables (ALVs) and Swiss chard.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Parents (n\,=\,29) responsible for food preparation for children in grade 2 to 4 in two schools were purposively selected for four focus group discussions. A sensory evaluation assessed the children's (n\,=\,98) acceptance of, preference for and intended consumption of dishes made with leafy vegetables. The dishes were made of Amaranthus spp., Cleome gynandra, Cucurbita maxima, Vigna unguiculata and Beta vulgaris.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Parents mentioned 30 edible ITPs during the focus group discussions. Parents had knowledge of available ITPs and their use as food. Location, seasonal variation and rainfall affected the availability of and access to ITPs. Sun-dried ITPs were stored in sacks for later use. ITPs were perceived as healthy, affordable and delicious, hence acceptable to the parents. The children also evaluated the dishes made with ALVs as acceptable in terms of colour, smell and taste. Swiss chard was preferred, most likely because of the children's exposure to this vegetable. Children indicated that they would like to eat these leafy vegetables twice a week.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: These results look promising for the promotion of ITPs as a strategy to reduce malnutrition in rural farm communities and for potential inclusion of these micronutrient-rich ALVs in school feeding programmes to improve the nutritional status of children.},

  abstract = {Better understanding of microbial compositional and physiological acclimation mechanisms is critical for predicting terrestrial ecosystem responses to global change. The aim is to assess variations in soil microbial communities under future scenarios of changing precipitation and N deposition in a semiarid grassland of northern China. In order to explicitly estimate microbial responses, a field experiment with water and N addition was established in April 2005 and continuously conducted for 4 years. Specifically, soil microbial community composition and microbial C utilization potential were determined by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and community-level physiological profiles, respectively. Water addition had no effects on the PLFA concentrations of gram-positive (GP) and negative bacteria (GN), total bacteria and fungi. However, N addition caused significant reductions in the PLFA concentrations of GP, GN, total bacteria and fungi and thus decreased total PLFA of microbial communities. Moreover, there were interactive effects of water and N addition on GN/GP and the ratio of fungal to bacterial PLFA (F/B). In addition, synergistic effects were found between water and nitrogen in affecting microbial C utilization potentials, which implies that microbial C utilization potentials tend to be enhanced when both N and water availability are sufficient. Overall, the microbial responses to water and N addition support our hypothesis that water and N addition may be combined together to affect microbial communities in the semiarid grassland.},

  abstract = {Predicting future ecosystems changes is necessary for better managing human resources. Such forecasting requires robust vegetation models which have been tested versus observed field data. Nowadays, it is very common that a simulation model is firstly validated using modern observed data and then tested versus palaeodata. In a sense, ecological data represent the natural laboratory for modelers. Thus, palaeo and actuo-ecological data are key points when dealing with predicting future changes. The present work represents the first step in such data-model comparison approach. Here, we use only modern plants distributions to test the robustness of our ecosystems definitions and use these definitions for testing a dynamic vegetation model. We have defined twenty-nine Bioclimatic affinity groups (BAGs) for 196 dominant plant species including trees, shrubs and herbs in China. These BAGs are characterized by the phenology and the climatic tolerances of the species they include. They are detailed enough to describe all vegetation types in China including the tropical, the subtropical, the temperate and the high altitude (Tibet Plateau) ecosystems. The climatic thresholds of these 29 BAGs were then used to test and validate a global dynamic vegetation model (CARAIB). The simulated BAGs are in good agreement with those observed in China, especially in the Tibetan Plateau and in the subtropical ecosystems. Broadly, all simulated BAGs fit quite well with the modern distribution. However, they all cover larger areas than the observed distributions, especially in the temperate region and in some areas in the northwest and the tropical zone. These discrepancies between simulated and observed distributions are related to the fact that the vegetation models simulate potential distributions. In China during recent decades natural ecosystems, mostly in the temperate zone, have been strongly altered in their species composition and geographical extent by different human activities such as the intense cultivation, deforestation, introduction of fast growing species and grazing. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} Huang et al.},

  abstract = {The effect of future climate scenarios on surface water and groundwater resources has been shown to have a consequent impact on water-dependent ecosystems. A regional-scale analysis of changes in water resources as a result of changing climate was undertaken in south-western Australia; a region with a large number of nationally and internationally recognised water-dependent ecosystems. The paper examines the potential environmental impacts of a substantial reduction in rainfall and an increase in temperature as projected by global climate models (GCMs) on river and groundwater-dependent terrestrial vegetation by 2030.Climate change effects on environmentally significant flow regimes were evaluated by applying the climate projections from 15 GCMs under three global warming 'scenarios to rainfall-runoff and groundwater models. It was estimated that under a . dry future climate scenario, the frequency of river flow rates important for ecological communities is likely to be reduced by up to 2. months per year, which is likely to cause a significant level of stress to ecological communities. Additionally, the duration of no-flow periods may increase by more than 120. days in some streams. Under a . dry future climate scenario, groundwater-dependent vegetation is projected to be at a high risk in over 19\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of its current habitat area. Water-dependent ecosystems are also projected to be affected by an increase in groundwater abstraction.The results indicate that the projected impacts of future climate conditions are not likely to be uniform across the region but overall they could cause a continuing threat to water-dependent ecosystems. The implementation of water management plans should place particular emphasis on the ecological water requirements in 6 of the 13 river catchments in south-western Australia and in areas where groundwater abstraction is high. The climate projections and ecological impacts are a continuation of the trends that have taken place in the past three decades. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2012.},

  abstract = {Ecological regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning indicators of impending shifts. A critical question, however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or shoreline development (only gradual restoration is possible). The model represents key features of a broad class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers can only be manipulated gradually management action is needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated, often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is also dependent on developing policy processes that enable society to respond more rapidly to information about impending regime shifts.},

Modeling studies evolved from analysis based on simple land or ocean carbon cycle models to comprehensive Earth System Models accounting for state-of-the-art climate models coupled to land and ocean biogeochemical models. So far, there is a general agreement that climate change negatively affects the oceanic uptake of carbon. On land there was a similar agreement until recently where new studies showed that warming could reduce nitrogen limitation to growth, reducing the amplitude, or even changing the sign of, the land feedback. In parallel, alternative approaches used the observational record of atmospheric CO2 and temperature, on time scales ranging from interannual to millennial, to estimate the climate-carbon cycle feedback. These studies confirmed that at the global scale, warming leads to a release of CO2 from the land/ocean system to the atmosphere. Whether these observations can strongly constrain the magnitude of the feedback under future climate change is still under investigation. \textcopyright{} 2010.},

The Central Red Sea is a highly under-investigated area, where healthy coral reefs are contending against intense coastal development. This in-situ study investigated both the independent and combined effects of manipulated inorganic nutrient enrichment (simulation of eutrophication) and herbivore exclosure (simulation of overfishing) on benthic algae development. Light-exposed and shaded terracotta tiles were positioned at an offshore patch reef close to Thuwal, Saudi Arabia and sampled over a period of 4 months. Findings revealed that nutrient enrichment alone affected neither algal dry mass nor algae-derived C or N production. In contrast, herbivore exclusion significantly increased algal dry mass up to 300-fold, and in conjunction with nutrient enrichment, this total increased to 500-fold. Though the increase in dry mass led to a 7 and 8-fold increase in organic C and N content, respectively, the algal C/N ratio (18$\pm$1) was significantly lowered in the combined treatment relative to controls (26$\pm$2). Furthermore, exclusion of herbivores significantly increased the relative abundance of filamentous algae on the light-exposed tiles and reduced crustose coralline algae and non-coralline red crusts on the shaded tiles. The combination of the herbivore exclusion and nutrient enrichment treatments pronounced these effects. The results of our study suggest that herbivore reduction, particularly when coupled with nutrient enrichment, favors non-calcifying, filamentous algae growth with high biomass production, which thoroughly outcompetes the encrusting (calcifying) algae that dominates in undisturbed conditions. These results suggest that the healthy reefs of the Central Red Sea may experience rapid shifts in benthic community composition with ensuing effects for biogeochemical cycles if anthropogenic impacts, particularly overfishing, are not controlled.},

Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere $<$350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m-2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite $\geq$ 80\% of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone ($<$5\% reduction in O3 concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N yr-1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use ($<$4000 km3 yr-1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change ($<$15\% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of $<$10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social\textendash{}ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of ``planetary boundaries'' lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minimizing negative externalities, toward the estimation of the safe space for human development. Planetary boundaries define, as it were, the boundaries of the ``planetary playing field'' for humanity if we want to be sure of avoiding major human-induced environmental change on a global scale.},

  abstract = {Global climate change is predicted to increase the variability in weather patterns with more extreme weather conditions occurring on a more frequent basis. Little information exists on thermal limits of fishes from highly variable environments. This study evaluated the thermal maximum and minimum of checkered puffers, yellowfin mojarra, schoolmaster snapper, and bonefish across seasons. Thermal scope (i.e., CTmax--CTmin) of nearshore fishes ranged from 24 to 28.6 \$$\backslash$,\^\{$\backslash$circ\}\$C across seasons, with thermal scopes typically being larger in the winter (January 1, 2012--March 22, 2012) than in the summer (June 26, 2012--November 9, 2012). Acclimatization response ratios (AZRR; \{\$\}$\backslash$Delta\{$\backslash$\$\}CTmax \{\$\}$\backslash$Delta\{$\backslash$\$\}T-1 and \{\$\}$\backslash$Delta\{$\backslash$\$\}CTmin \{\$\}$\backslash$Delta\{$\backslash$\$\}T-1) were typically greater than 0.60 for all species, a value greater than most previously reported for fish species from variable thermal environments. Present-day maximum and minimum temperatures in the nearshore environment are approximately equal to or exceed the thermal tolerance limits of the fish in this study, making thermal safety margins (TSM; i.e., the difference between thermal tolerance limit and extreme environmental temperature) very small or negative for nearshore fishes (TSM upper = -4.9 to 0.5; lower = -0.2 to 0.4). The IPCC's worse-case scenario will push maximum temperatures beyond the TSM of all nearshore fish in this study. Distribution of fishes in the nearshore environment in the future will depend on available thermal refuge, cost of migrating, and food web interactions. Overall, the thermal landscape in the nearshore environment in the future will likely benefit species with positive thermal safety margins that are capable of acclimatizing (e.g., schoolmaster snapper), while relatively intolerant species (e.g., bonefish) may inhabit these systems less frequently or will be absent in the future. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

We conducted a field experiment in northern China to examine the influence of 2-year N addition on species composition and community structure in three temperate grasslands with different land use history: steppe fenced for two years (ST), steppe fenced for five years (SF), and old field grassland fenced for five years (OF). The results showed previous farming reduced species diversity and plant cover, which is mainly caused by decrease in perennial grasses (PG) and forbs (PF). Nitrogen addition increased plant cover, especially the PG cover, but had little effects on species diversity. Nitrogen enrichment also has a tendency to alter community composition by decreasing proportional cover of PF but increasing that of PG and annuals and biennials (AB), suggesting enhanced dominance of PG under increasing N deposition. Irrespective of the short-term (2 years) experimental periods, our findings highlight the dominant role of land use history in structuring plant community, and have valuable implications for grassland conservation and model projections of ecosystem succession under global scenarios of N deposition in the semi-arid grasslands. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Recent studies show that current trends in yield improvement will not be sufficient to meet projected global food demand in 2050, and suggest that a further expansion of agricultural area will be required. However, agriculture is the main driver of losses of biodiversity and a major contributor to climate change and pollution, and so further expansion is undesirable. The usual proposed alternative\textemdash{}intensification with increased resource use\textemdash{}also has negative effects. It is therefore imperative to find ways to achieve global food security without expanding crop or pastureland and without increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Some authors have emphasized a role for sustainable intensification in closing global `yield gaps' between the currently realized and potentially achievable yields. However, in this paper we use a transparent, data-driven model, to show that even if yield gaps are closed, the projected demand will drive further agricultural expansion. There are, however, options for reduction on the demand side that are rarely considered. In the second part of this paper we quantify the potential for demand-side mitigation options, and show that improved diets and decreases in food waste are essential to deliver emissions reductions, and to provide global food security in 2050.},

The factors controlling surface 03 concentrations are discussed initially to provide a basis for the ensuing discussion, followed by a summary of the evidence for recent trends in ground-level ozone concentrations, i.e. over the past 3 decades, which have shown a significant increase in the annual average in ‘background' air typical of the unpolluted northern hemisphere. Closer to precursor sources, although urban winter concentrations have increased, rural peak spring and summer concentrations during ozone ‘episodes' have decreased markedly in response to emissions reductions. In order to determine whether such trends are meaningful, the statistical techniques for determining temporal trends are reviewed. The possible causes of long-term trends in ozone are then discussed, with particular reference to the use of chemistry-transport models to interpret past trends. Such models are also used to make predictions of future trends in surface ozone concentrations, but few are comprehensive in integrating future climate changes with changes in land use and in emissions of ozone precursors. Guidance is given on the likely effects of climate/precursor/chemistry interactions so that model predictions can be judged. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Extreme heat stress during the crop reproductive period can be critical for crop productivity.
Projected changes in the frequency and severity of extreme climatic events are expected to
negatively impact crop yields and global food production. This study applies the global crop model
PEGASUS to quantify, for the first time at the global scale, impacts of extreme heat stress on
maize, spring wheat and soybean yields resulting from 72 climate change scenarios for the 21st
century. Our results project maize to face progressively worse impacts under a range of RCPs but
spring wheat and soybean to improve globally through to the 2080s due to CO 2 fertilization effects,
even though parts of the tropic and sub-tropic regions could face substantial yield declines. We
find extreme heat stress at anthesis (HSA) by the 2080s (relative to the 1980s) under RCP 8.5,
taking into account CO 2 fertilization effects, could double global losses of maize yield ( $\Delta$ Y =
-12.8 $\pm$ 6.7\% versus - 7.0 $\pm$ 5.3\% without HSA), reduce projected gains in spring wheat yield by half
( $\Delta$ Y = 34.3 $\pm$ 13.5\% versus 72.0 $\pm$ 10.9\% without HSA) and in soybean yield by a quarter ( $\Delta$ Y = 15.3
$\pm$ 26.5\% versus 20.4 $\pm$ 22.1\% without HSA). The range reflects uncertainty due to differences between
climate model scenarios; soybean exhibits both positive and negative impacts, maize is generally
negative and spring wheat generally positive. Furthermore, when assuming CO 2 fertilization effects
to be negligible, we observe drastic climate mitigation policy as in RCP 2.6 could avoid more than
80\% of the global average yield losses otherwise expected by the 2080s under RCP 8.5. We show large
disparities in climate impacts across regions and find extreme heat stress adversely affects major
producing regions and lower income countries.},

  abstract = {We used an Earth System Model that includes both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cycling to simulate the impacts of land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) for two representative concentration pathways (RCPs): a reforestation scenario (RCP4.5) and a deforestation scenario (RCP8.5). For each RCP, we performed simulations with and without LULCC using the carbon (C only) mode or including the full C, N and P cycles (CNP). We show, for the first time, that inclusion of N and P cycling reduces both the carbon uptake from reforestation in RCP4.5 and the carbon emission from deforestation in RCP8.5. Specifically, carbon-nutrient interaction reduces carbon uptake in RCP4.5 from 55 Pg C (C only) to 21 Pg C (CNP), or the emissions in RCP8.5 from 72 Pg C (C only) to 56 Pg C (CNP). Most of those reductions result from much weaker responses of net primary production to CO 2 fertilization and climate change when carbon-nutrient interaction is taken into account, as compared to C only simulations. Our results highlight the importance of including nutrient-carbon interaction in estimating the carbon benefit from reforestation and carbon loss from deforestation in a future world with higher CO 2 and a warmer climate. Because of the stronger nutrient limitation, carbon gain from reforestation in the temperate and boreal regions is much less than the carbon loss from deforestation in the subtropical and tropical regions from 2006 to 2100 for the two RCPs. Therefore protecting the existing subtropical and tropical forests is about twice as effective as planting new forests in the temperate and boreal regions for climate mitigation.},

  abstract = {The majority of the worlds food production capability is inextricably tied to global precipitation patterns. Changes in moisture availability-whether from changes in climate from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions or those induced by land cover change (LCC)-can have profound impacts on food production. In this study, we examined the patterns of evaporative sources that contribute to moisture availability over five major global food producing regions (breadbaskets), and the potential for land cover change to influence these moisture sources by altering surface evapotranspiration. For a range of LCC scenarios we estimated the impact of altered surface fluxes on crop moisture availability and potential yield using a simplified linear hydrologic model and a state-of-the-art ecosystem and crop model. All the breadbasket regions were found to be susceptible to reductions in moisture owing to perturbations in evaporative source (ES) from LCC, with reductions in moisture availability ranging from 7 to 17\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} leading to potential crop yield reductions of 117\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\}, which are magnitudes comparable to the changes anticipated with greenhouse warming. The sensitivity of these reductions in potential crop yield to varying magnitudes of LCC was not consistent among regions. Two variables explained most of these differences: the first was the magnitude of the potential moisture availability change, with regions exhibiting greater reductions in moisture availability also tending to exhibit greater changes in potential yield; the second was the soil moisture within crop root zones. Regions with mean growing season soil moisture fractions of saturation \{\{\}\{$>$\}\{\}\}0.5 typically had reduced impacts on potential crop yield. Our results indicate the existence of LCC thresholds that have the capability to create moisture shortages adversely affecting crop yields in major food producing regions, which could lead to future food supply disruptions in the absence of increased irrigation or other forms of water management. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

We discuss how HANPP is defined, measured, and interpreted. Two principal approaches for constructing HANPP assessments exist: (a) In an area-specific approach, HANPP serves as an indicator of land-use intensity, gauging impacts on terrestrial ecosystems in a defined area; and (b) the consumption-based ``embodied HANPP'' approach allows assessment of impacts related to individual products or the aggregate consumption of nation-states.

Its chapters and their executive summaries were accepted, and its summary for policymakers approved, by the fourth session of the Plenary of IPBES (22-28 February 2016, Kuala Lumpur).

They also want to understand the implications of different policy choices on biodiversity and ecosystem services, and how to achieve policy targets, e.g., the Aichi targets.To address the concerns of decision makers the IPBES scenarios and modelling assessment considered the roles of scenarios and models within the IPBES conceptual framework, and assessed the roles of three types of scenarios within the policy cycle, i.e., (i) ``exploratory scenarios'', which represent different plausible futures, often based on storylines; (ii) ``target-seeking scenarios'', also known as ``normative scenarios'', which represent an agreed-upon future target and scenarios that provide alternative pathways for reaching this target; and (iii) ``policy- screening scenarios'', also known as ``ex-ante scenarios'', which represent various policy options under consideration.},

Ectothermic organisms such as amphibians and reptiles are especially vulnerable as climatic conditions affect them directly. Ecological niche models (ENMs) are increasingly popular in ecological studies, but several drawbacks exist, including the limited ability to account for the dispersal potential of the species. In this study, we use ENMs to explore the impact of global climate change on the Caspian whip snake (Dolichophis caspius) as model for organisms with low dispersal abilities and to quantify dispersal to novel areas using GIS techniques. Models generated using Maxent 3.3.3 k and GARP for current distribution were projected on future climatic scenarios. A cost-distance analysis was run in ArcGIS 10 using geomorphological features, ecological conditions, and human footprint as \{"\}costs\{"\} to dispersal of the species to obtain a Maximum Dispersal Range (MDR) estimate. All models developed were statistically significant (P\{\{\}\{$<$\}\{\}\}0.05) and recovered the currently known distribution of D. caspius. Models projected on future climatic conditions using Maxent predicted a doubling of suitable climatic area, while GARP predicted a more conservative expansion. Both models agreed on an expansion of suitable area northwards, with minor decreases at the southern distribution limit. The MDR area calculated using the Maxent model represented a third of the total area of the projected model. The MDR based on GARP models recovered only about 20\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of the total area of the projected model.

Results indicate that complex interactions between life history, disturbance regime and distribution pattern mediate species extinction risks under climate change.

  abstract = {Bioethanol production from sugarcane is discussed as an alternative energy source to reduce dependencies of regional economies on fossil fuels. Even though bioethanol production from sugarcane is considered to be a beneficial and cost-effective greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation strategy, it is still a matter of controversy due to insufficient information on the total GHG balance of this system. Aside from the necessity to account for the impact of land use change (LUC), soil N(2)O emissions during sugarcane production and emissions of GHG due to preharvest burning may significantly impact the GHG balance. Based on a thorough literature review, we show that direct N(2)O emissions from sugarcane fields due to nitrogen (N) fertilization result in an emission factor of 3.87 +/- 1.16\% which is much higher than suggested by IPCC (1\%). N(2)O emissions from N fertilization accounted for 40\% of the total GHG emissions from ethanol-sugarcane production, with an additional 17\% from trash burning. If LUC-related GHG emissions are considered, the total GHG balance turns negative mainly due to vegetation carbon losses. Our study also shows that major gaps in knowledge still exist about GHG sources related to agricultural management during sugarcane production, e. g. effects of irrigation, vinasse and filter cake application. Therefore, more studies are needed to assess if bioethanol from sugarcane is a viable option to reduce energy-related GHG emissions.},

  abstract = {The influence of the environment and environmental change is largely unrepresented in standard theories of migration, whilst recent debates on climate change and migration focus almost entirely on displacement and perceive migration to be a problem. Drawing on an increasing evidence base that has assessed elements of the influence of the environment on migration, this paper presents a new framework for understanding the effect of environmental change on migration. The framework identifies five families of drivers which affect migration decisions: economic, political, social, demographic and environmental drivers. The environment drives migration through mechanisms characterised as the availability and reliability of ecosystem services and exposure to hazard. Individual migration decisions and flows are affected by these drivers operating in combination, and the effect of the environment is therefore highly dependent on economic, political, social and demographic context. Environmental change has the potential to affect directly the hazardousness of place. Environmental change also affects migration indirectly, in particular through economic drivers, by changing livelihoods for example, and political drivers, through affecting conflicts over resources, for example. The proposed framework, applicable to both international and internal migration, emphasises the role of human agency in migration decisions, in particular the linked role of family and household characteristics on the one hand, and barriers and facilitators to movement on the other in translating drivers into actions. The framework can be used to guide new research, assist with the evaluation of policy options, and provide a context for the development of scenarios representing a range of plausible migration futures. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Synthesizing experiments from around the world, we show that CO2 fertilization is best explained by a simple interaction between nitrogen availability and mycorrhizal association. Plant species that associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi show a strong biomass increase (30 $\pm$ 3\%, P $<$ 0.001) in response to elevated CO2 regardless of nitrogen availability, whereas low nitrogen availability limits CO2 fertilization (0 $\pm$ 5\%, P = 0.946) in plants that associate with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. The incorporation of mycorrhizae in global carbon cycle models is feasible, and crucial if we are to accurately project ecosystem responses and feedbacks to climate change.},

These aspects interrelate across multiple scales. Resilience in this context is the capacity of a SES to continually change and adapt yet remain within critical thresholds. Adaptability is part of resilience. It represents the capacity to adjust responses to changing external drivers and internal processes and thereby allow for development along the current trajectory (stability domain). Transformability is the capacity to cross thresholds into new development trajectories. Transformational change at smaller scales enables resilience at larger scales. The capacity to transform at smaller scales draws on resilience from multiple scales, making use of crises as windows of opportunity for novelty and innovation, and recombining sources of experience and knowledge to navigate social-ecological transitions. Society must seriously consider ways to foster resilience of smaller more manageable SESs that contribute to Earth System resilience and to explore options for deliberate transformation of SESs that threaten Earth System resilience.},

  abstract = {Global environmental change is rapidly altering the dynamics of terrestrial vegetation, with consequences for the functioning of the Earth system and provision of ecosystem services(1,2). Yet how global vegetation is responding to the changing environment is not well established. Here we use three long-term satellite leaf area index (LAI) records and ten global ecosystem models to investigate four key drivers of LAI trends during 1982-2009. We show a persistent and widespread increase of growing season integrated LAI (greening) over 25\% to 50\% of the global vegetated area, whereas less than 4\% of the globe shows decreasing LAI (browning). Factorial simulations with multiple global ecosystem models suggest that CO2 fertilization effects explain 70\% of the observed greening trend, followed by nitrogen deposition (9\%), climate change (8\%) and land cover change (LCC) (4\%). CO2 fertilization effects explain most of the greening trends in the tropics, whereas climate change resulted in greening of the high latitudes and the Tibetan Plateau. LCC contributed most to the regional greening observed in southeast China and the eastern United States. The regional effects of unexplained factors suggest that the next generation of ecosystem models will need to explore the impacts of forest demography, differences in regional management intensities for cropland and pastures, and other emerging productivity constraints such as phosphorus availability.},

  isbn = {978-0-8213-8621-7},
  abstract = {The Amazon basin is a key component of the global carbon cycle. The old-growth rainforests in the basin represent storage of \textasciitilde{} 120 petagrams of carbon (Pg C) in their biomass. Annually, these tropical forests process approximately 18 Pg C through respiration and photosynthesis. This is more than twice the rate of global anthropogenic fossil fuel emissions. The basin is also the largest global repository of biodiversity and produces about 20 percent of the world's flow of fresh water into the oceans. Despite the large carbon dioxide (CO2) efflux from recent deforestation, the Amazon rainforest ecosystem is still considered to be a net carbon sinks of 0.8-1.1 Pg C per year because growth on average exceeds mortality (Phillips et al. 2008). However, current climate trends and human-induced deforestation may be transforming forest structure and behavior (Phillips et al. 2009). Increasing temperatures may accelerate respiration rates and thus carbon emissions from soils (Malhi and Grace 2000). High probabilities for modification in rainfall patterns (Malhi et al. 2008) and prolonged drought stress may lead to reductions in biomass density. Resulting changes in evapo-transpiration and therefore convective precipitation could further accelerate drought conditions and destabilize the tropical ecosystem as a whole, causing a reduction in its biomass carrying capacity or dieback. In turn, changes in the structure of the Amazon and its associated water cycle will have implications for the many endemic species it contains and result in changes at a continental scale. Clearly, with much at stake, if climate-induced damage alters the state of the Amazon ecosystem, there is a need to better understand its risk, process, and dynamics. The objective of this study is to assist in understanding the risk, process, and dynamics of potential Amazon dieback and its implications.},

  abstract = {$<$p$>$Land-surface models (LSMs) are increasingly called upon to represent not only the exchanges of energy, water and momentum across the land\textendash{}atmosphere interface (their original purpose in climate models), but also how ecosystems and water resources respond to climate, atmospheric environment, land-use and land-use change, and how these responses in turn influence land\textendash{}atmosphere fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}), trace gases and other species that affect the composition and chemistry of the atmosphere. However, the LSMs embedded in state-of-the-art climate models differ in how they represent fundamental aspects of the hydrological and carbon cycles, resulting in large inter-model differences and sometimes faulty predictions. These "third-generation" LSMs respect the close coupling of the carbon and water cycles through plants, but otherwise tend to be under-constrained, and have not taken full advantage of robust hydrological parameterizations that were independently developed in offline models. Benchmarking, combining multiple sources of atmospheric, biospheric and hydrological data, should be a required component of LSM development, but this field has been relatively poorly supported and intermittently pursued. Moreover, benchmarking alone is not sufficient to ensure that models improve. Increasing complexity may increase realism but decrease reliability and robustness, by increasing the number of poorly known model parameters. In contrast, simplifying the representation of complex processes by stochastic parameterization (the representation of unresolved processes by statistical distributions of values) has been shown to improve model reliability and realism in both atmospheric and land-surface modelling contexts. We provide examples for important processes in hydrology (the generation of runoff and flow routing in heterogeneous catchments) and biology (carbon uptake by species-diverse ecosystems). We propose that the way forward for next-generation complex LSMs will include: (a) representations of biological and hydrological processes based on the implementation of multiple internal constraints; (b) systematic application of benchmarking and data assimilation techniques to optimize parameter values and thereby test the structural adequacy of models; and (c) stochastic parameterization of unresolved variability, applied in both the hydrological and the biological domains.$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {Extreme climate events are observed and predicted to increase in frequency and duration in high-latitude ecosystems as a result of global climate change. This includes extreme precipitation events, which may directly impact on belowground food webs and ecosystem functioning by their physical impacts and by altering local soil moisture conditions.We assessed responses of the Collembola community in a northern Sphagnum fuscum-dominated ombrotrophic peatland to three years of experimentally increased occurrence of extreme precipitation events. Annual summer precipitation was doubled (an increase of 200. mm) by 16 simulated extreme rain events within the three months growing season, where on each occasion 12.5. mm of rain was added within a few minutes. Despite this high frequency and intensity of the rain events, no shifts in Collembola density, relative species abundances and community weighted means of three relevant traits (moisture preference, vertical distribution and body size) were observed. This strongly suggests that the peatland Collembola community is unaffected by the physical impacts of extreme precipitation and the short-term variability in moisture conditions. The lack of response is most likely reinforced by the fact that extreme precipitation events do not seem to alter longer-term soil moisture conditions in the peat layers inhabited by soil fauna.This study adds evidence to the observation that the biotic components of northern ombrotrophic peatlands are hardly responsive to an increase in extreme summer precipitation events. Given the importance of these ecosystems for the global C balance, these findings significantly contribute to the current knowledge of the ecological impact of future climate scenarios. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Projected changes in the frequency and severity of extreme climatic events are expected to
negatively impact crop yields and global food production. This study applies the global crop model
PEGASUS to quantify, for the first time at the global scale, impacts of extreme heat stress on
maize, spring wheat and soybean yields resulting from 72 climate change scenarios for the 21st
century. Our results project maize to face progressively worse impacts under a range of RCPs but
spring wheat and soybean to improve globally through to the 2080s due to CO 2 fertilization effects,
even though parts of the tropic and sub-tropic regions could face substantial yield declines. We
find extreme heat stress at anthesis (HSA) by the 2080s (relative to the 1980s) under RCP 8.5,
taking into account CO 2 fertilization effects, could double global losses of maize yield ( $\Delta$ Y =
-12.8 $\pm$ 6.7\% versus - 7.0 $\pm$ 5.3\% without HSA), reduce projected gains in spring wheat yield by half
( $\Delta$ Y = 34.3 $\pm$ 13.5\% versus 72.0 $\pm$ 10.9\% without HSA) and in soybean yield by a quarter ( $\Delta$ Y = 15.3
$\pm$ 26.5\% versus 20.4 $\pm$ 22.1\% without HSA). The range reflects uncertainty due to differences between
climate model scenarios; soybean exhibits both positive and negative impacts, maize is generally
negative and spring wheat generally positive. Furthermore, when assuming CO 2 fertilization effects
to be negligible, we observe drastic climate mitigation policy as in RCP 2.6 could avoid more than
80\% of the global average yield losses otherwise expected by the 2080s under RCP 8.5. We show large
disparities in climate impacts across regions and find extreme heat stress adversely affects major

  doi = {10.1890/07-0361.1},
  abstract = {Insects and spiders comprise more than two-thirds of the Earth's total species diversity. There is wide concern, however, that the global diversity of arthropods may be declining even more rapidly than the diversity of vertebrates and plants. For adequate conservation planning, ecologists need to understand the driving factors for arthropod communities and devise methods that provide reliable predictions when resources do not permit exhaustive ground surveys. Which factor most successfully predicts arthropod community structure is still a matter of debate, however. The purpose of this study was to identify the factor best predicting arthropod assemblage composition. We investigated the species composition of seven functionally different arthropod groups (epigeic spiders, grasshoppers, ground beetles, weevils, hoppers, hoverflies, and bees) at 47 sites in The Netherlands comprising a range of seminatural grassland types and one heathland type. We then compared the actual arthropod composition with predictions based on plant species composition, vegetation structure, environmental data, flower richness, and landscape composition. For this we used the recently published method of predictive co-correspondence analysis, and a predictive variant of canonical correspondence analysis, depending on the type of predictor data. Our results demonstrate that local plant species composition is the most effective predictor of arthropod assemblage composition, for all investigated groups. In predicting arthropod assemblages, plant community composition consistently outperforms both vegetation structure and environmental conditions (even when the two are combined), and also performs better than the surrounding landscape. These results run against a common expectation of vegetation structure as the decisive factor. Such expectations, however, have always been biased by the fact that until recently no methods existed that could use an entire (plant) species composition in the explanatory role. Although more recent experimental diversity work has reawakened interest in the role of plant species, these studies still have not used (or have not been able to use) entire species compositions. They only consider diversity measures, both for plant and insect assemblages, which may obscure relationships. The present study demonstrates that the species compositions of insect and plant communities are clearly linked. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

However, the extent to which actual temperatures deviate from those of the freely circulating atmosphere had never been assessed at a landscape level. Here, we quantify thermal life conditions across topographically rich mountain terrain by using a combination of thermal (IR) imagery of surface temperature with data from a large number of miniature data loggers buried at 3cm soil depth. The data obtained from six alpine (Alps) and arctic-alpine slopes (Norway, Sweden, Svalbard) evidence persistent root zone temperatures of 2\textendash{}4K above air temperature during summer. Surface temperatures show strong positive (2\textendash{}9K) and negative (3\textendash{}8K) deviations from air tempera- ture on bright days and clear nights, respectively. As to be expected, south oriented slopes are warmer than west and north slopes but microclimatic variation on clear sky days was strong within all slopes, with 8.4 2.5K (mean SD) surface temperature differences persisting over several hours per day along horizontal (i.e., equal elevation) transects. Life conditions of alpine organisms are thus strongly decoupled from conditions in the free atmosphere and cannot reliably be inferred from climate station data in both, temperate and arctic latitudes. Microtopography can mimic temperature differences of large elevational (or latitudinal) gradients over very short horizontal distances. This is important in the context of climate change because it shows that species do not necessarily need to climb several hundred meters in elevation to escape the warmth. Quite often, few meters of horizontal shift will do. For plants unable to, or too slow to adapt to a warmer climate, thermal microhabitat mosaics offer both refuge habitats as well as stepping stones as atmospheric temperatures rise},

Strong reductions in attainable yields of major cereal crops are found across a large fraction of current cropland by 2050. These areas are vulnerable to climate change and have greatly reduced opportunity for agricultural intensification. However, the total land area, including regions not currently used for crops, climatically suitable for high attainable yields of maize, wheat and rice is similar by 2050 to the present-day. Large shifts in land-use patterns and crop choice will likely be necessary to sustain production growth rates and keep pace with demand.},

We find important trade-offs exist regarding the cost and capacity needed to run and interpret the models, the range of impacts they cover, and regarding the spatial scale that each operates which may overstate impacts at one end and underestimate impacts at the other. Understanding these differences is critical for managers and policy makers to make informed decisions about which model to use and how to interpret and apply the results. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the role of Inuit traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) in adaptation to climate change in the Canadian Arctic. It focuses on Inuit relationships with the Arctic environment, including hunting knowledge and land skills, and examines their roles in adaptation to biophysical changes that affect subsistence hunting. In several instances, TEK underpins competency in subsistence and adaptations to changing conditions, which includes  flexibility  with regard to seasonal cycles of hunting and resource use,  hazard avoidance  through detailed knowledge of the environment and understanding of ecosystem processes, and  emergency preparedness , e.g., knowing what supplies to take when traveling and how to respond in emergency situations. Despite the documented importance of TEK in adaptation and in maintaining a level of competency in subsistence, the relationships between TEK and adaptation to climate change are not well defined in the scholarly literature. This paper aims to conceptualize the relationships between TEK and adaptation to climate change by drawing on case study research with Inuit in the Canadian Arctic. TEK is considered an element of adaptive capacity (or resilience) that is expressed as adaptation if TEK is drawn upon to adapt to changing conditions. This capacity depends on the development, accumulation, and transmission of TEK within and among generations.},

  abstract = {In temperate areas, microclimate is a key factor affecting the population dynamics of insects, but very few studies have examined the potential significance of microclimate in diverse tropical insect communities. We quantified the diversity and structure of butterfly communities in 2 different microhabitats, over seasons, and examined which abiotic (microclimate) and biotic (vegetation structure) components affected community composition. The study was performed from Jun 2009 to May 2010 at a dry forest in Ecuador, a globally threatened habitat with high levels of endemism. Two transects were established, one in each microhabitat, where baited traps were located in the understory and canopy to record butterfly species abundance. Humidity and temperature were recorded during the sampling period and vegetation variables were measured. A total of 3,731 individuals representing 93 species were collected. Higher species richness and abundances were found during the wet season. Linear regression models and CCA analyses showed microclimatic variability and vegetation structure (e.g., vegetation density) were significant predictors of the composition and abundance of butterfly communities. Major lineages of butterflies differed in their response to microclimate and microhabitat, explaining some of the spatial variation in community structure. In addition, some of the most abundant species changed their microhabitat preferences in the dry season. The tight relationship between butterfly communities, microclimate and microhabitat suggests that global climate change and habitat alteration are likely to act synergistically on tropical dry forest insect faunas, and these processes should thus be considered together in predicting future impacts on biodiversity.},

  abstract = {There are few formal studies on the contribution of botanical gardens as urban green spaces, particularly within developing countries. Therefore, this paper reports on an assessment of the use and appreciation of botanical gardens as urban green spaces in South Africa. Users and staff were surveyed in six national botanical gardens. The gardens provided numerous benefits in terms of conservation, education and recreation. However, the people using the gardens were not demographically representative of the general population of the surrounding city or town. Generally, most of the visitors were middle- to old-aged, well-educated professionals with medium to high incomes. Most were white and English was their home language. There was an even gender representation. Most visited only a few times per year. The majority of users visited the gardens for recreation and psychological reasons rather than educational ones. However, the staff of each garden placed emphasis on education in the gardens and amongst surrounding schools. Most visitors appreciated the conservation dimensions of botanical gardens, and felt that there was insufficient public green space in their town or city. Understanding how people perceive and use the botanical gardens of South Africa is important to inform future research and strategies regarding the conservation of urban green space within a developing country. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

  abstract = {This chapter introduces to the function of organic matter in soils and its chemistry in different soils. Organic carbon enters the soil via root and litter deposition and is composed of a vast range of different precursor molecules. These compounds are only partly mineralized and new microbial structures are synthesized, leading to an alteration of the chemical composition of soil organic matter (SOM). The underlying rates determine the turnover of SOM in soil, with some compounds degrading faster (labile C pools) while other being protected from potential rapid decay (stable C pools). Biomarker and stable isotope techniques are applied as tools for elucidating both the origin and residence time of specific SOM components. In general, the residence time of a given compound is lower if it is either not bioaccessible or not bioavailable for decay, that is, when stabilization processes delay its rapid decomposition. Whereas the major proportion of SOM is mineralized within months, stabilized SOM fractions may reside in soil at timescales of decades to several millennia. These processes contribute to the open soil C cycle, with feedback mechanisms to the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. It is important for plant growth, climate regulation, weathering, and soil formation as well as soil fertility. \textcopyright{} 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Anthropogenic pressures on the Earth System have reached a scale where abrupt global environmental change can no longer be excluded. We propose a new approach to global sustainability in which we define planetary boundaries within which we expect that humanity can operate safely. Transgressing one or more planetary boundaries may be deleterious or even catastrophic due to the risk of crossing thresholds that will trigger non-linear, abrupt environmental change within continental- to planetary-scale systems. We have identified nine planetary boundaries and, drawing upon current scientific understanding, we propose quantifications for seven of them. These seven are climate change (CO2 concentration in the atmosphere $<$350 ppm and/or a maximum change of +1 W m-2 in radiative forcing); ocean acidification (mean surface seawater saturation state with respect to aragonite $\geq$ 80\% of pre-industrial levels); stratospheric ozone ($<$5\% reduction in O3 concentration from pre-industrial level of 290 Dobson Units); biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycle (limit industrial and agricultural fixation of N2 to 35 Tg N yr-1) and phosphorus (P) cycle (annual P inflow to oceans not to exceed 10 times the natural background weathering of P); global freshwater use ($<$4000 km3 yr-1 of consumptive use of runoff resources); land system change ($<$15\% of the ice-free land surface under cropland); and the rate at which biological diversity is lost (annual rate of $<$10 extinctions per million species). The two additional planetary boundaries for which we have not yet been able to determine a boundary level are chemical pollution and atmospheric aerosol loading. We estimate that humanity has already transgressed three planetary boundaries: for climate change, rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle. Planetary boundaries are interdependent, because transgressing one may both shift the position of other boundaries or cause them to be transgressed. The social impacts of transgressing boundaries will be a function of the social\textendash{}ecological resilience of the affected societies. Our proposed boundaries are rough, first estimates only, surrounded by large uncertainties and knowledge gaps. Filling these gaps will require major advancements in Earth System and resilience science. The proposed concept of ``planetary boundaries'' lays the groundwork for shifting our approach to governance and management, away from the essentially sectoral analyses of limits to growth aimed at minim\ldots{}},

  abstract = {A life cycle optimization of the replacement of residential central air conditioners (CACs) was conducted in order to identify replacement schedules that minimized three separate objectives: life cycle energy consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and consumer cost. The analysis was conducted for the time period of 1985-2025 for Ann Arbor, MI and San Antonio, TX. Using annual sales-weighted efficiencies of residential CAC equipment, the tradeoff between potential operational savings and the burdens of producing new, more efficient equipment was evaluated. The optimal replacement schedule for each objective was identified for each location and service scenario. In general, minimizing energy consumption required frequent replacement (4-12 replacements), minimizing GHG required fewer replacements (2-5 replacements), and minimizing cost required the fewest replacements (1-3 replacements) over the time horizon. Scenario analysis of different federal efficiency standards, regional standards, and Energy Star purchases were conducted to quantify each policy's impact. For example, a 16 SEER regional standard in Texas was shown to either reduce primary energy consumption 13\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\}, GHGs emissions by 11\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\}, or cost by 6-7\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} when performing optimal replacement of CACs from 2005 or before.

The available analyses of sustainability, however, have poorly assessed the role of the financial system in scenarios of future global change. Here we contrast current global flows in the financial system with the future economic costs of a worldwide transition to renewable energies under the baseline and 450 ppm scenarios for emissions of greenhouse gases proposed by the IPCC. We show that annual global financial flows are three orders of magnitude greater than the annual economic costs of policies for global sustainability. A small global tax on financial transactions of 0.05\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} could thus provide the required funds for the deployment of renewable energies. To assess the roles of the financial sector in future policies for sustainability, we identified 14 key international actors and enumerated 16 key policies for sustainability that should be implemented to achieve effective global ecological and financial sustainability. We conclude that the proposed structural reforms to the financial system are essential steps urgently required for financing a global transition to a sustainable economy. Consequently, we suggest that the international scientific community should urgently pursue an academic consensus on policy recommendations for the financial sector. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {While research continues on the causes, consequences, and rates of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics, there is little agreement about what exactly is being lost, what we want back, and to whom the 'we' refers. Particularly unsettling is that many analyses and well-intended actions are implemented in fogs of ambiguity surrounding definitions of the term 'forest'-a problem that is not solely semantic; with development of markets for biomass carbon, vegetation classification exercises take on new relevance. For example, according to the basic implementation guidelines of the Kyoto Protocol, closed canopy natural forest could be replaced by monoclonal plantations of genetically engineered exotic tree species and no deforestation would have occurred. Following these same guidelines, carbon credits for afforestation could be available for planting trees in species-rich savannas; these new plantations would count towards a country moving towards the 'forest transition,' the point at which there is no net 'forest' loss. Such obvious conflicts between biodiversity conservation and carbon sequestration might be avoided if 'forest' was clearly defined and if other vegetation types and other ecosystem values were explicitly recognized. While acknowledging that no one approach to vegetation classification is likely to satisfy all users at all scales, we present an approach that recognizes the importance of species composition, reflects the utility of land-cover characteristics that are identifiable via remote sensing, and acknowledges that many sorts of forest degradation do not reduce carbon stocks (e. g., defaunation) or canopy cover (e. g., over-harvesting of understory nontimber forest products)},

Alternative diets that offer substantial health benefits could, if widely adopted, reduce global agricultural greenhouse gas emissions, reduce land clearing and resultant species extinctions, and help prevent such diet-related chronic non-communicable diseases.

to 2004 were first modelled by seasonal time series analyses and then
used to create a general model. Excluding collinear variables allowed
the data set to be condensed to six variables that could be fitted into
a general linear model that explained similar to 75\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of the observed
annual variation in chlorophyll a. A clear seasonal influence was
apparent, with chlorophyll a tracking trends in temperature and the
progress of spring. A nonseasonal influence was also observed in the
interaction of two biological components, the proportion of
phytoplankton biomass available to Daphnia (i.e. the percentage of
ingestible size \{\{\}\{$<$\}\{\}\} 30 mu m) and the grazing intensity. In combination,
these biotic variables had a negative impact on chlorophyll a levels. In
contrast, the concentration of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP)
correlated positively with chlorophyll a. The effect of SRP showed a
significant seasonal component, as it was more abundant in spring than
at other times of year. In general, the model predicts a negative
exponential response of chlorophyll a to further depletion of SRP in
Lake Constance, while the temperature trends predicted by current global
warming scenarios will result in a moderate increase in productivity.
Data from 2005 to 2007 were used to verify the model. The modelled
chlorophyll a values were nonbiased and showed a close match to the
measured values (r2: 75\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\}). Thus the applicability, reliability, and
informative value of the model for pelagic Lake Constance was confirmed.

Climate change represents a major challenge to the survival and viability of species, and the potential consequences must be assessed to allow for mitigation.

We predict decreases in species richness in all areas with high species richness (\{\{\}\{$>$\}\{\}\}80 species) at 20502080, using bioclimatic IPCC scenarios A2 (a severe scenario, continuously increasing human population size, regional changes in economic growth) and B1 (the greenest scenario, global population peaking mid-century). We also predicted changes in species richness in scenarios that project vegetation changes in addition to climate change up to 2050. At 2050 and 2080, A2 and B1 scenarios incorporating changes in climatic factors predicted that 39\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} species would lose all currently suitable niche space.

When potential vegetation and climate changes were combined only 1\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of species showed no changes in their predicted ranges by 2050. Although some species are projected to expand ranges, this may be ecologically impossible due to potential barriers to dispersal, especially for species with poor dispersal ability. Only 113\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of species showed no projected reductions in their current range under bioclimatic scenarios. An effective way to facilitate range shift for dispersal-limited species is to improve landscape connectivity.

Microclimate and ecophysiology of sun and shade plants were studied at a continental plateau in central Spain during 2004-2005, with 2005 being one of the driest and hottest years on record; several late-winter frosts also occurred in 2005. Daytime air temperature and vapour pressure deficit were lower in the shade than in the sun, but soil moisture was also lower in the shade during the spring and summer of 2005, and night-time temperatures were higher in the shade. Water potential, photochemical efficiency, light-saturated photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and leaf (13)C composition differed between sun and shade individuals throughout the seasons, but differences were species specific. Shade was beneficial for leaf-level physiology in Q. ilex during winter, detrimental during spring for both species, and of little consequence in summer. The results suggest that beneficial effects of shade can be eclipsed by reduced soil moisture during dry years, which are expected to be more frequent in the most likely climate change scenarios for the Mediterranean region.},

  abstract = {Possible negative effects of increased competition for land include pressures on biodiversity, rising food prices and GHG emissions. However, neoclassical economists often highlight positive aspects of competition, e.g. increased efficiency and innovation. Competition for land occurs when several agents demand the same good or service produced froma limited area. It implies thatwhen one agent acquires scarce resources from land, less resource is available for competing agents. The resource competed for is often not land but rather its function for biomass production,which may be supplanted by other inputs that raise yields. Increased competitionmay stimulate efficiency but negative environmental effects are likely in the absence of appropriate regulations. Competition between affluent countries with poor people in subsistence economies likely results in adverse social and development outcomes if not mitigated through effective policies. The socioecological metabolism approach is a framework to analyze land-related limits and functions in particular with respect to production and consumption of biomass and carbon sequestration. It can generate databases that consistently link land usedwith biomass flows which are useful in understanding interlinkages between different products and services and thereby help to analyze systemic feedbacks in the global land system.},

Moreover, there is currently no global forest map that is consistent with forest statistics from FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations). By combining these diverse data sources into a single forest cover product, it is possible to produce a global forest map that is more accurate than the individual input layers and to produce a map that is consistent with FAO statistics. In this paper we applied geographically weighted regression (GWR) to integrate eight different forest products into three global hybrid forest cover maps at a 1. km resolution for the reference year 2000. Input products included global land cover and forest maps at varying resolutions from 30. m to 1. km, mosaics of regional land use/land cover products where available, and the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields product. The GWR was trained using crowdsourced data collected via the Geo-Wiki platform and the hybrid maps were then validated using an independent dataset collected via the same system. Three different hybrid maps were produced: two consistent with FAO statistics, one at the country and one at the regional level, and a "best guess" forest cover map that is independent of FAO.

The study used 3 years of eddy covariance (EC) and large aperture scintillometer (LAS) flux measurements to evaluate the bio-physical processes that control the surface energy partitioning. A comparison of sensible heat flux (SH) by EC (HEC) and LAS (HLAS) showed HECwas slightly underestimated due to wind turbulence and energy balance closure issues. The Noah Land Surface Model (LSM) was configured with NCEP-NARR (NOAHNARRsimulation) or meteorological observation from the EC tower (NOAHObssimulation). NOAHNARRsimulation showed significantly more RMSE compared to NOAHObsdue to biases in downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation and precipitation (P) in the NARR data. Higher leaf area index (LAI) and moderate stomatal resistance (RS) of lodgepole pine resulted in increased evapotranspiration (ET) (472\textendash{}535 mm/year) compared to cheatgrass (261 mm to 278 mm/year) and sagebrush (229\textendash{}353 mm/year). The Budyko ET analysis showed that all the three sites are water deficient and the evaporative ratio was less for the lodgepole pine ecosystem (0.80) when compared to sagebrush (0.94) and cheatgrass (0.93). The residual (attributed to deep percolation and runoff) from the water budget was higher (15\textendash{}16\%) in the lodgepole pine compared to that of cheatgrass (2\textendash{}5\%) and sagebrush (2\textendash{}9\%). Our results indicate the field-scale distinguishing features of heterogeneous ecosystems in the semi-arid environment and emphasize the need for intercomparison of flux measurements for better understanding of energy budget partitioning and improving the accuracy of simulated fluxes.},

  title = {Large Uncertainty in Carbon Uptake Potential of Land-Based Climate-Change Mitigation Efforts},
  doi = {10.1111/gcb.14144},
  abstract = {Most climate mitigation scenarios involve negative emissions, especially those that aim to limit global temperature increase to 2$^\circ$C or less. However, the carbon uptake potential in land-based climate change mitigation efforts is highly uncertain. Here, we address this uncertainty by using two land-based mitigation scenarios from two land-use models (IMAGE and MAgPIE) as input to four dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs; LPJ-GUESS, ORCHIDEE, JULES, LPJmL). Each of the four combinations of land-use models and mitigation scenarios aimed for a cumulative carbon uptake of \textasciitilde{}130 GtC by the end of the century, achieved either via the cultivation of bioenergy crops combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or avoided deforestation and afforestation (ADAFF). Results suggest large uncertainty in simulated future land demand and carbon uptake rates, depending on the assumptions related to land use and land management in the models. Total cumulative carbon uptake in the DGVMs is highly variable across mitigation scenarios, ranging between 19 and 130 GtC by year 2099. Only one out of the 16 combinations of mitigation scenarios and DGVMs achieves an equivalent or higher carbon uptake than achieved in the land-use models. The large differences in carbon uptake between the DGVMs and their discrepancy against the carbon uptake in IMAGE and MAgPIE are mainly due to different model assumptions regarding bioenergy crop yields, and due to the simulation of soil carbon response to land-use change. Differences between land-use models and DGVMs regarding forest biomass and the rate of forest regrowth also have an impact, albeit smaller, on the results. Given the low confidence in simulated carbon uptake for a given land-based mitigation scenario, and that negative emissions simulated by the DGVMs are typically lower than assumed in scenarios consistent with the 2$^\circ$C target, relying on negative emissions to mitigate climate change is a highly uncertain strategy.

Therefore, evaluation on building energy efficiency and human thermal comfort is extremely necessary. In the present work, energy conservation performance of one passive school building and classroom thermal comfort enhancement will be simultaneously investigated. Energy performance of single reference classroom under six design points and whole school building with two scenarios have been numerically investigated concerning the effects of different indoor set-point temperatures, pre-ventilation, sun-shading system, and the efficiency of the heat recovery facility. Numerical results demonstrate that heating and cooling demands heavily depend on indoor set-point temperature, occupancy and heat recovery rate. Building energy performance analysis illuminates that the optimized control systems for HVAC and sun-shading systems show an expectedly energy efficient performance. In addition, classroom thermal comfort indicated by the recommended thermal range and comfort zone has been numerically and experimentally presented. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.jtbi.2013.08.032},
  abstract = {Host mobility plays a fundamental role in the spatial spread of infectious diseases. Previous theoretical works based on the integration of network theory into the metapopulation framework have shown that the heterogeneities that characterize real mobility networks favor the propagation of epidemics. Nevertheless, the studies conducted so far assumed the mobility process to be either Markovian (in which the memory of the origin of each traveler is lost) or non-Markovian with a fixed traveling time scale (in which individuals travel to a destination and come back at a constant rate). Available statistics however show that the time spent by travelers at destination is characterized by wide fluctuations, ranging from a single day up to several months. Such varying length of stay crucially affects the chance and duration of mixing events among hosts and may therefore have a strong impact on the spread of an emerging disease. Here, we present an analytical and a computational study of epidemic processes on a complex subpopulation network where travelers have memory of their origin and spend a heterogeneously distributed time interval at their destination. Through analytical calculations and numerical simulations we show that the heterogeneity of the length of stay alters the expression of the threshold between local outbreak and global invasion, and, moreover, it changes the epidemic behavior of the system in case of a global outbreak. Additionally, our theoretical framework allows us to study the effect of changes in the traveling behavior in response to the infection, by considering a scenario in which sick individuals do not leave their home location. Finally, we compare the results of our non-Markovian framework with those obtained with a classic Markovian approach and find relevant differences between the two, in the estimate of the epidemic invasion potential, as well as of the timing and the pattern of its spatial spread. These results highlight the importance of properly accounting for host trip duration in epidemic models and open the path to the inclusion of such an additional layer of complexity to the existing modeling approaches. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Voluntary carbon offsets represent a growing share of the carbon market as a whole, and have the potential to contribute to meeting greenhouse gas emissions targets and reducing anthropogenic climate change. Certain offset project types may also deliver co-benefits including safeguarding or promoting biodiversity, supporting human development and poverty reduction, and enabling market and technology development in low-carbon sectors. These co-benefits might encourage consumers to participate in the voluntary offset market, depending on their effects both on consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for offsets and on implementation costs. However, the offset market is not yet sufficiently developed to give a clear indication of consumer WTP for offsets with varying attributes. This exploratory stated preference study therefore uses a choice experiment to estimate WTP for certified and uncertified offsets, with or without these specific co-benefits, in an aviation context. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to do so. Our results suggest that uptake of voluntary offsets may be encouraged by investing in projects with co-benefits and by emphasising those co-benefits to consumers. They also suggest that certification regimes will add value to offsets, helping compensate for increased costs, provided that consumers are made fully aware of them. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {In the eastern United States, winter temperature has been increasing nearly twice as fast as summer temperature, but studies of warming effects on plants have focused on species that are photosynthetically active in summer. The terrestrial orchid Tipularia discolor is leafless in summer and acquires C primarily in winter. The optimum temperature for photosynthesis in T. discolor is higher than the maximum temperature throughout most of its growing season, and therefore growth can be expected to increase with warming. Contrary to this hypothesis, experimental warming negatively affected reproductive fitness (number of flowering stalks, flowers, fruits) and growth (change in leaf area from 2010 to 2012) in T. discolor. Temperature in June--July was critical for flowering, and mean July temperature greater than 29 \$$\backslash$,\^\{$\backslash$circ\}\$C (i.e., 2.5 \$$\backslash$,\^\{$\backslash$circ\}\$C above ambient) eliminated reproduction. Warming of 1.2 \$$\backslash$,\^\{$\backslash$circ\}\$C delayed flowering by an average of 10 days and fruiting by an average of 5 days. Warming of 4.4 \$$\backslash$,\^\{$\backslash$circ\}\$C reduced relative growth rates by about 60 \{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\}, which may have been partially caused by the direct effects of temperature on photosynthesis and respiration. Warming indirectly increased vapor pressure deficit (VPD) by 0.2--0.5 kPa, and leaf-to-air VPD over 1.3 kPa restricted stomatal conductance of T. discolor to 10--40 \{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of maximum conductance. These results highlight the need to account for changes in VPD when estimating temperature responses of plant species under future warming scenarios. Increasing temperature in the future will likely be an important limiting factor to the distribution of T. discolor, especially along the southern edge of its range. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

The details of land modeling for common stabilization policy scenarios are, for the first time, presented, contrasted, and assessed. While we find significant differences in approaches across modeling platforms, all the approaches conclude that land based mitigation \textendash{} agriculture, forestry, and biomass liquid and solid energy substitutes \textendash{} could be a steady and significant part of the cost-effective portfolio of mitigation strategies; thereby, reducing stabilization cost and increasing flexibility for achieving more aggressive climate targets. However, large fossil fuel emissions reductions are still required, and there are substantial uncertainties, with little agreement about abatement magnitudes. Across the scenarios, land mitigation options contribute approximately 100 to 340GtC equivalent abatement over the century, 15 to 40\% of the total required for stabilization, with bio-energy providing up to 15\% of total primary energy. Long-run land climate modeling is rapidly evolving with critical challenges to address. In characterizing current capability, this paper hopes to stimulate future research and the next generation of land modeling and provide a point of comparison for energy and climate policies considering bio-energy, reduced deforestation and degradation, and cost containment.},

  abstract = {Providing food, energy and materials for the rising global population is
a challenge which is compounded by increased pressure on natural
resources such as land, water and fossil sources of raw materials.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from human activities have increased with
industrial development and population expansion, and it is anticipated
that resulting climate change might further limit agricultural
productivity, through changes to weather patterns and global
availability/distribution of agriculturally productive land. Growing
crops as feedstocks for industrial uses is seen as one way of reducing
GHG emissions and dependency on fossil resources. However, determining
the extent to which the development of crops for industrial use will
effect GHG balances and provide for a more energy efficient
manufacturing system requires the development and use of appropriate
calculation methodologies.
Research at the Porter Institute has identified over 250 different
scenarios for bioenergy production systems using commodity crops. In
order to rationalise this complexity and diversity, a modular approach
to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and sustainability analysis has been
taken. This allows characterisation of discrete sections of supply
chains and enables comparisons to be made between different crop
production systems, different process systems and different end product
uses. The purposes of this paper are to introduce the concepts of
biofuel GHG and sustainability metrics, to introduce the approach taken
by our organization and to use the example of UK grown willow in a
lignocellulosic ethanol production system to demonstrate how GHG
emission outcomes can be reviewed for ‘‘new\{\{\}\{\{\}\{\}\}''\{\{\}\{\}\}\{\}\} crops and technologies.
The results show a range of variation, in both growing and process
systems and how outcomes such as energy and GHG balances can be affected
by various activities.
LCA methodologies provide data to inform governments and industry of the
potential specific supply chains may have for energy and GHG saving.
However, methodological approaches can also affect assessment outcomes.
Unresolved issues in LCA methodology must also be evaluated e.g. impacts
resulting from land use change. Sustainability assessments of crop
growing systems, irrespective of the end use, also assist in the
assessment of environmental impacts of supply chains. However, it is
critical that data continue to be collected, analysed and reviewed, to
ensure that the most appropriate crops are grown and processed for the
most appropriate end use. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier

  abstract = {SignificanceFeedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to atmospheric CO2 concentrations contribute the second-largest uncertainty to projections of future climate. These feedbacks, acting over huge regions and long periods of time, are extraordinarily difficult to observe and quantify directly. We evaluated in situ, atmospheric, and simulation estimates of the effect of CO2 on carbon storage, subject to mass balance constraints. Multiple lines of evidence suggest significant tropical uptake for CO2, approximately balancing net deforestation and confirming a substantial negative global feedback to atmospheric CO2 and climate. This reconciles two approaches that have previously produced contradictory results. We provide a consistent explanation of the impacts of CO2 on terrestrial carbon across the 12 orders of magnitude between plant stomata and the global carbon cycle. Feedbacks from the terrestrial carbon cycle significantly affect future climate change. The CO2 concentration dependence of global terrestrial carbon storage is one of the largest and most uncertain feedbacks. Theory predicts the CO2 effect should have a tropical maximum, but a large terrestrial sink has been contradicted by analyses of atmospheric CO2 that do not show large tropical uptake. Our results, however, show significant tropical uptake and, combining tropical and extratropical fluxes, suggest that up to 60\% of the present-day terrestrial sink is caused by increasing atmospheric CO2. This conclusion is consistent with a validated subset of atmospheric analyses, but uncertainty remains. Improved model diagnostics and new space-based observations can reduce the uncertainty of tropical and temperate zone carbon flux estimates. This analysis supports a significant feedback to future atmospheric CO2 concentrations from carbon uptake in terrestrial ecosystems caused by rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This feedback will have substantial tropical contributions, but the magnitude of future carbon uptake by tropical forests also depends on how they respond to climate change and requires their protection from deforestation.},

  abstract = {Observations and projections for mountain regions show a strong tendency towards upslope displacement of their biomes under future climate conditions. Because of their climatic and topographic heterogeneity, a more complex response is expected for biodiversity hotspots such as tropical mountain regions. This study analyzes potential changes in the distribution of biomes in the Tropical Andes and identifies target areas for conservation. Biome distribution models were developed using logistic regressions. These models were then coupled to an ensemble of 8 global climate models to project future distribution of the Andean biomes and their uncertainties. We analysed projected changes in extent and elevational range and identified regions most prone to change. Our results show a heterogeneous response to climate change. Although the wetter biomes exhibit an upslope displacement of both the upper and the lower boundaries as expected, most dry biomes tend to show downslope expansion. Despite important losses being projected for several biomes, projections suggest that between 74.8\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} and 83.1\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of the current total Tropical Andes will remain stable, depending on the emission scenario and time horizon. Between 3.3\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} and 7.6\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of the study area is projected to change, mostly towards an increase in vertical structure. For the remaining area (13.1\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\}-17.4\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\}), there is no agreement between model projections. These results challenge the common believe that climate change will lead to an upslope displacement of biome boundaries in mountain regions. Instead, our models project diverging responses, including downslope expansion and large areas projected to remain stable. Lastly, a significant part of the area expected to change is already affected by land use changes, which has important implications for management. This, and the inclusion of a comprehensive uncertainty analysis, will help to inform conservation strategies in the Tropical Andes, and to guide similar assessments for other tropical mountains. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2013 Tovar et al.},

  abstract = {Degradation of soil and land resources is a critical global problem. It is widespread not only in drylands and cropped areas, but in most agro-ecologies and biomes around the world. Unless addressed, it may undermine global food security and negatively affect the livelihoods of billions of people, especially of the poor. Addressing land degradation requires public, community and private actions informed and supported by evidence-based research. The current paper reviews the recent economic literature on land degradation and improvement with the purpose of highlighting major new insights and continuing gaps. Drawing conclusions from the recent research under the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative, we find that action against land degradation has considerably higher economic, environmental and social returns than inaction. The drivers of land degradation are numerous and often context-specific, so addressing them requires targeting not some individual driver in isolation, but through comprehensive and mutually consistent packages of policy actions. We suggest the following conceptual, methodological and empirical areas for future research on economics of land degradation. Firstly, more interdisciplinary conceptual frameworks are required to connect land degradation and other intricately related issues such as climate change, water scarcity, loss of biodiversity, energy and food security. In this regard, Water-Energy-Food Security (WEF) Nexus concept can be highly useful as one of such nexus platforms for future trans-disciplinary research on economics of land degradation. Secondly, more rigorous methodologies are needed on the incorporation of the value of ecosystem services into economic calculations. Finally, there is a need for empirical studies tracing the dynamic economic and social impacts of land degradation across scales: from household to global level.},

Few global-scale assessments have been carried out, and these are limited in their ability to capture the uncertainty in climate projections, and omit potentially important aspects such as extreme events and changes in pests and diseases. There is a lack of clarity on how climate change impacts on drought are best quantified from an agricultural perspective, with different metrics giving very different impressions of future risk. The dependence of some regional agriculture on remote rainfall, snowmelt and glaciers adds to the complexity. Indirect impacts via sea-level rise, storms and diseases have not been quantified. Perhaps most seriously, there is high uncertainty in the extent to which the direct effects of CO(2) rise on plant physiology will interact with climate change in affecting productivity.

  abstract = {The ciliates living in a shallow groundwater system in southern Ontario, Canada were subjected to an in situ temperature manipulation over 14 months. Ciliates were collected from the bed surface of a small springbrook and from interstitial water collected at five depths beneath its surface. Mean temperature elevations established at each depth (-20, -40, -60, -80, and -100 cm) between the experiment's control and treatment blocks were 1.9, 3.5, 3.9, 3.8, and 3.6 degrees C, respectively, and were based on global warming projections for the region. In total, 160 species of ciliate belonging to 85 genera were identified. Overall, the treatment block had a higher density (6510 +/- 342 cells L-1; +/- 1 SE) than the control (5797 +/- 237 cells L-1), but densities were both vertically and longitudinally variable. Control densities decreased with depth, whereas treatment densities were more equal among depths. Total species richness showed no significant difference between blocks when combining all sampling dates and depths, although species composition changed. The ciliate community was dominated by small (15-50 mu m), followed by medium (50-200 mu m), and only a few large-sized (\{\{\}\{$>$\}\{\}\} 200 mu m) species. Small ciliates contributed 82-97\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of the total density. Small ciliates also contributed more to the treatment (94\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\}) than the control block (88\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\}). The most common ciliate feeding groups were bacterivores, omnivores, predators, and algae-diatom feeders, with bacterivores being most dominant (83-99\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of the total numbers collected). Ordination analyses revealed that ciliate distribution was strongly correlated with groundwater temperature, although dissolved oxygen level, concentrations of ammonia and nitrate, and depth also appeared to be influential. Peak densities of many species occurred in either the control or treatment blocks, but not in both. The benefits of using ciliates as a proxy for higher, much longer-lived, eukaryotes in climate change studies are discussed.},

  abstract = {Land use and climate change can accelerate the depletion of freshwater resources that support humans and ecosystem services on a global scale. Here, we briefly review studies from around the world, and highlight those in this special issue. We identify stages that characterize increasing interaction between land use and climate change. During the first stage, hydrologic modifications and the built environment amplify overland flow via processes associated with runoff-dominated ecosystems (e.g., soil compaction, impervious surface cover, drainage, and channelization). During the second stage, changes in water storage impact the capacity of ecosystems to buffer extremes in water quantity and quality (e.g., either losses in snowpack, wetlands, and groundwater recharge or gains in water and nutrient storage behind dams in reservoirs). During the third stage, extremes in water quantity and quality contribute to losses in ecosystem services and water security (e.g., clean drinking water, flood mitigation, and habitat availability). During the final stage, management and restoration strategies attempt to regain lost ecosystem structure, function, and services but need to adapt to climate change. By anticipating the increasing interaction between land use and climate change, intervention points can be identified, and management strategies can be adjusted to improve outcomes for realistic expectations. Overall, global water security cannot be adequately restored without considering an increasing interaction between land use and climate change across progressive stages and our ever-increasing human domination of the water cycle from degradation to ecosystem restoration.},

  abstract = {Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion. Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100-110\% increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, \textasciitilde{}1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO(2)-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching \textasciitilde{}3 Gt y(-1) and N use \textasciitilde{}250 Mt y(-1) by then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only \textasciitilde{}0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of \textasciitilde{}1 Gt y(-1), and global N use of \textasciitilde{}225 Mt y(-1). Efficient management practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts.},

We identified seven grand challenges within three themes (valuation, governance, and externalities) and 34 research needs and management actions. The major themes identified are to (1) raise awareness of diverse values associated with inland fish and fisheries, (2) govern inland fish and fisheries to satisfy multiple use and conservation objectives, and (3) ensure productive inland fisheries given nonfishing sector externalities.

  abstract = {There is growing interest in understanding how declining soil fertility in the prolonged absence of major disturbance drives ecological processes, or `ecosystem retrogression'. However, there are few well characterized study systems for exploring this phenomenon in the tropics, despite tropics occupying over 40\% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. We studied two types of montane rain forest in the Blue Mountains of Jamaica that represent distinct stages in ecosystem development, i.e. an earlier stage with shallow organic matter and a late stage with deep organic matter (hereafter `mull' and `mor' stages). We characterized responses of soil fertility and plant, soil microbial and nematode communities to the transition from mull to mor and whether these responses were coupled. For soil abiotic properties, we found this transition led to lower amounts of both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and an enhanced N to P ratio. This led to shorter-statured and less diverse forest, and convergence of tree species composition among plots. At the whole community (but not individual species) level foliar and litter N and P diminished from mull to mor, while foliar N to P and resorption efficiency of P relative to N increased, indicating increasing P relative to N limitation. We also found impairment of soil microbes (but not nematodes) and an increasing role of fungi relative to bacteria during the transition. Our results show that retrogression phenomena involving increasing nutrient (notably P) limitation can be important drivers in tropical systems, and are likely to involve aboveground\textendash{}belowground feedbacks whereby plants produce litter of diminishing quality, impairing soil microbial processes and thus reducing the supply of nutrients from the soil for plant growth. Such feedbacks between plants and the soil, mediated by plant litter and organic matter quality, may serve as major though often overlooked drivers of long term environmental change.},

Despite its widely recognized importance for terrestrial C sequestration, to date, no Earth System Model (ESM) implements soil erosion effects on carbon cycling in sufficient detail. So far, available studies have mostly investigated the magnitude of erosional C transport and in-situ measurements of vertical C fluxes on the catchment or regional scale. Recognizing the need to adequately represent C erosion processes and controls in ESMs, we provide a comprehensive cross-disciplinary review on lateral C redistribution in the landscape and discuss the implications for biogeochemical cycling of carbon. We present current knowledge on the role of erosional C distribution in controlling the stabilization and release of C in soils, taking into consideration the important geomorphic, ecological, hydrologic, pedologic and micro-climatic processes and controls that affect soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, fluxes, and persistence in dynamic landscapes. Further, we provide an overview on latest experimental and modelling approaches that are being used to investigate the role of erosion in the carbon cycle. Finally, to advance our understanding of the role of soil redistribution in biogeochemical cycles of essential elements, we discuss the most promising topics for future research in this field.},

  abstract = {Global forests are increasingly affected by land-use change, fragmentation, changing management objectives, and degradation. In this paper we broadly characterize trends in global forest area by intensity of management, and provide an overview of changes in global carbon stocks associated with managed forests. We discuss different interpretations of "management" and highlight some important accounting and analysis issues. The area of global forests has declined by 3\% since 1990 but the area of planted forest has increased in all regions of the world and now accounts for almost 7\% of global forest land. The area of primary forest, which is typically defined as lacking direct human influence, is about 34\% of all forest land according to country reports, but the area is declining especially in South America and Africa because of human-caused habitat fragmentation and degradation. Concurrently, the area of naturally regenerated forest that is not classified as primary forest has declined. As a result of increasing management intensity, the area of unmanaged forest, typically defined as land lacking protected status or a management plan, dropped significantly since 1990 and now comprises only 21\% of global forests. There have been significant increases in areas of forest used for non-wood forest products such as protection of soil and water, conservation of biodiversity, and provision of social services. Globally, timber production has been relatively stable since 1990, but increasing areas of forest used for non-wood forest products indicates that harvesting is taking place on a smaller proportion of the total forest area. Based on trends in the area of managed forest and regional studies, it is clear that historical and current forest management has been a very significant determining factor of current carbon stocks. Established forests currently offset about 30\% of global emissions of CO2from fossil fuel use, and there are mitigation opportunities involving forests that could increase the gross terrestrial C uptake from roughly 4.0 to 6.2PgC annually. However, our results suggest that a diversifying use of forest land may have significant consequences for maintaining or increasing the current rate of terrestrial carbon sequestration. In the future, indirect human influences such as increasing atmospheric CO2and climate change, along with the direct effects of land management and projected increasing demand for wood biofuel, are likely to become increasing\ldots{}},

Today, the synergistic effects of human impacts are laying the groundwork for a comparably great Anthropocene mass extinction in the oceans with unknown ecological and evolutionary consequences. Synergistic effects of habitat destruction, overfishing, introduced species, warming, acidification, toxins, and massive runoff of nutrients are transforming once complex ecosystems like coral reefs and kelp forests into monotonous level bottoms, transforming clear and productive coastal seas into anoxic dead zones, and transforming complex food webs topped by big animals into simplified, microbially dominated ecosystems with boom and bust cycles of toxic dinoflagellate blooms, jellyfish, and disease. Rates of change are increasingly fast and nonlinear with sudden phase shifts to novel alternative community states. We can only guess at the kinds of organisms that will benefit from this mayhem that is radically altering the selective seascape far beyond the consequences of fishing or warming alone. The prospects are especially bleak for animals and plants compared with metabolically flexible microbes and algae. Halting and ultimately reversing these trends will require rapid and fundamental changes in fisheries, agricultural practice, and the emissions of greenhouse gases on a global scale.},

  abstract = {The land-use sector can contribute to climate change mitigation not only by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but also by increasing carbon uptake from the atmosphere and thereby creating negative CO2 emissions. In this paper, we investigate two land-based climate change mitigation strategies for carbon removal: (1) afforestation and (2) bioenergy in combination with carbon capture and storage technology (bioenergy CCS). In our approach, a global tax on GHG emissions aimed at ambitious climate change mitigation incentivizes land-based mitigation by penalizing positive and rewarding negative CO2 emissions from the land-use system. We analyze afforestation and bioenergy CCS as standalone and combined mitigation strategies. We find that afforestation is a cost-efficient strategy for carbon removal at relatively low carbon prices, while bioenergy CCS becomes competitive only at higher prices. According to our results, cumulative carbon removal due to afforestation and bioenergy CCS is similar at the end of 21st century (600-700 GtCO(2)), while land-demand for afforestation is much higher compared to bioenergy CCS. In the combined setting, we identify competition for land, but the impact on the mitigation potential (1000 GtCO(2)) is partially alleviated by productivity increases in the agricultural sector. Moreover, our results indicate that early-century afforestation presumably will not negatively impact carbon removal due to bioenergy CCS in the second half of the 21st century. A sensitivity analysis shows that land-based mitigation is very sensitive to different levels of GHG taxes. Besides that, the mitigation potential of bioenergy CCS highly depends on the development of future bioenergy yields and the availability of geological carbon storage, while for afforestation projects the length of the crediting period is crucial.},

  abstract = {From its advent in 2005 within global climate change negotiations, reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and other forest-related activities (so-called REDD+) has been experimented with in developing country contexts for over a decade now, with a wide array of expectations coming to be associated with it. Three consecutive conceptualizations are identifiable: carbon-centered, where REDD+ is primarily a climate mitigation strategy; co-benefits-centered, where REDD+ becomes a triple win solution for climate, biodiversity and communities; and landscape-centered, where REDD+ activities are embedded in integrated sustainable land-use approaches. In assessing such evolving expectations against existing REDD+ experiences, a mixed picture emerges. Some expectations, specifically relating to forest carbon financing, are not being adequately met, while others, notably the delivery of co-benefits, hold out more promise. Yet this also highlights a potential paradox facing REDD+. While there is growing recognition that co-benefit generation is key, and that piece-meal, forest-carbon focused REDD+ interventions are unlikely to address the complex causes of tropical forest loss, forest carbon is still being foregrounded in measuring and reporting on REDD+ performance, and in generating results-based payments (even as these aspects remain challenging). This implies, however, that the future of REDD+ may lie not in one conceptualization coming to dominate, but rather in coexistence of heterogeneous practices. REDD+ may end up as a patchwork of projects and practices with different foci and financing mechanisms. Although this cannot prevent trade-offs, such a heterodox REDD+ may provide building blocks for the polycentric governance of the world's remaining tropical forests. (C) 2016 The Authors.

  abstract = {In today's globalized world, humans and nature are inextricably linked. The coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) framework provides a lens with which to understand such complex interactions. One of the central components of the CHANS framework involves examining feedbacks among human and natural systems, which form when effects from one system on another system feed back to affect the first system. Despite developments in understanding feedbacks in single disciplines, interdisciplinary research on CHANS feedbacks to date is scant and often site-specific, a shortcoming that prevents complex coupled systems from being fully understood. The special feature "Exploring Feedbacks in Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS)" makes strides to fill this critical gap. Here, as an introduction to the special feature, we provide an overview of CHANS feedbacks. In addition, we synthesize key CHANS feedbacks that emerged in the papers of this special feature across agricultural, forest, and urban landscapes. We also examine emerging themes explored across the papers, including multilevel feedbacks, time lags, and surprises as a result of feedbacks. We conclude with recommendations for future research that can build upon the foundation provided in the special feature.},

  abstract = {Climate change scenarios vary considerably over the Amazon region, with an extreme scenario projecting a dangerous (from the human perspective) increase of 3.88C in temperature and 30\% reduction in precipita- tion by 2050. The impacts of such climate change on Amazonian land-use dynamics, agricultural production, and deforestation rates are still to be de- termined. In this study, the authors make a first attempt to assess these impacts through a systemic approach, using a spatially explicit modeling framework to project crop yield and land-use/land-cover changes in the Brazilian Amazon by 2050. The results show that, without any adaptation, climate change may exert a critical impact on the yields of crops commonly cultivated in the Amazon (e.g., soybean yields are reduced by 44\% in the worst-case scenario). Therefore, following baseline projections on crop and livestock production, a scenario of severe regional climate change would cause additional deforestation of 181 000 km2 (120\%) in the Amazon and 240 000 km2 (1273\%) in the Cer- rado compared to a scenario of moderate climate change. Putting an end to deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon forest by 2020 (and of the Cerrado by 2025) would require either a reduction of 26\%\textendash{}40\% in livestock production until 2050 or a doubling of average livestock density from 0.74 to 1.46 head per hectare. These results suggest that (i) climate change can affect land use in ways not previously explored, such as the reduction of yields entailing further de- forestation, and (ii) there is a need for an integrated/multidisciplinary plan for adaptation to climate change in the Amazon.},

  abstract = {Soils act as sources and sinks for greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). Since both storage and emission capacities may be large, precise quantifications are needed to obtain reliable global budgets that are necessary for land-use management (agriculture, forestry), global change and for climate research. This paper discusses exclusively the soil emission-related processes and their influencing parameters. It reviews soil emission studies involving the most important land-cover types and climate zones and introduces important measuring systems for soil emissions. It addresses current shortcomings and the obvious bias towards northern hemispheric data. When using a conservative average of 300 mg CO2e m-2h-1(based on our literature review), this leads to global annual net soil emissions of $\geq$350 Pg CO2e (CO2e = CO2equivalents = total effect of all GHG normalized to CO2). This corresponds to roughly 21\% of the global soil C and N pools. For comparison, 33.4 Pg CO2are being emitted annually by fossil fuel combustion and the cement industry.},

  abstract = {Tipping points - where systems shift radically and potentially irreversibly into a different state - have received considerable attention in ecology. Although there is convincing evidence that human drivers can cause regime shifts at local and regional scales, the increasingly invoked concept of planetary scale tipping points in the terrestrial biosphere remains unconfirmed. By evaluating potential mechanisms and drivers, we conclude that spatial heterogeneity in drivers and responses, and lack of strong continental interconnectivity, probably induce relatively smooth changes at the global scale, without an expectation of marked tipping patterns. This implies that identifying critical points along global continua of drivers might be unfeasible and that characterizing global biotic change with single aggregates is inapt. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

A transition in land use is not a fixed pattern, nor is it deterministic. Land use transitions can be caused by negative socio-ecological feedbacks that arise from a depletion of key resources or from socio-economic change and innovation that take place rather independently from the ecological system. Here, we explore whether the sources of land use transitions are mostly endogenous socio-ecological forces or exogenous socio-economic factors. We first review a few generic pathways of forest transition as identified in national case studies, and evaluate the varying ecological quality of expanding forests associated with these pathways. We then discuss possible explanatory frameworks of land use transitions. We use the case of the recent forest transition in Vietnam as an illustration. Socio-ecological feedbacks seem to better explain a slowing down of deforestation and stabilization of forest cover, while exogenous socio-economic factors better account for reforestation. We conclude by discussing the prospects of accelerating land use transitions in tropical forest countries. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Coping with environmental stress may involve combinations of behavioral and physiological responses. We examined potential interactions between adult mussels' simple behavioral repertoire - opening/closing of the shell valves - and thermal stress physiology in common-gardened individuals of three Mytilus congeners found on the West Coast of North America: two native species (M. californianus and M. trossulus) and one invasive species from the Mediterranean (M. galloprovincialis). We first continuously monitored valve behavior over three consecutive days on which body temperatures were gradually increased, either in air or in seawater. A temperature threshold effect was evident between 25 and 33\$$\backslash$,\^\{$\backslash$circ\}\$C in several behavioral measures. Mussels tended to spend much less time with the valves in a sealed position following exposure to 33\$$\backslash$,\^\{$\backslash$circ\}\$C body temperature, especially when exposed in air. This behavior could not be explained by decreases in adductor muscle glycogen (stores of this metabolic fuel actually increased in some scenarios), impacts of forced valve sealing on long-term survival (none observed in a second experiment), or loss of contractile function in the adductor muscles (individuals exhibited as many or more valve adduction movements following elevated body temperature compared with controls). We hypothesize that this reduced propensity to seal the valves following thermal extremes represents avoidance of hypoxia-reoxygenation cycles and concomitant oxidative stress. We further conjecture that prolonged valve gaping following episodes of elevated body temperature may have important ecological consequences by affecting species interactions. We then examined survival over a 90 day period following exposure to elevated body temperature and/or emersion, observing ongoing mortality throughout this monitoring period. Survival varied significantly among species (M. trossulus had the lowest survival) and among experimental contexts (survival was lowest after experiencing elevated body temperature in seawater). Surprisingly, we observed no cumulative impact on survival of 3 days relative to 1 day of exposure to elevated body temperature. The delayed mortality and context-specific outcomes we observed have important implications for the design of future experiments and for interpretation of field distribution patterns of these species. Ultimately, variation in the catalog of physiological and behavioral capacities among closely related or sympatric species is likely to complicate prediction of the ecological consequences of global change and species invasions. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2013.

  abstract = {One of the numerous applications of renewable energy is represented by the use of upgraded biogas where needed by feeding into the gas grid. The aim of the present study was to identify an upgrading scenario featuring minimum overall GHG emissions. The study was based on a life-cycle approach taking into account also GHG emissions resulting from plant cultivation to the process of energy conversion. For anaerobic digestion two substrates have been taken into account: (1) agricultural resources and (2) municipal organic waste. The study provides results for four different upgrading technologies including the BABIU (Bottom Ash for Biogas Upgrading) method. As the transport of bottom ash is a critical factor implicated in the BABIU-method, different transport distances and means of conveyance (lorry, train) have been considered. Furthermore, aspects including biogas compression and energy conversion in a combined heat and power plant were assessed. GHG emissions from a conventional energy supply system (natural gas) have been estimated as reference scenario. The main findings obtained underlined how the overall reduction of GHG emissions may be rather limited, for example for an agricultural context in which PSA-scenarios emit only 10\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} less greenhouse gases than the reference scenario. The BABIU-method constitutes an efficient upgrading method capable of attaining a high reduction of GHG emission by sequestration of CO2. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

N dynamics reduce terrestrial C storage due to CO2 fertilization over the period 1860-2100 by similar to 50\% (342 Pg C) mainly in mid-high latitude ecosystems, compared to a simulation not accounting for N dynamics. Conversely, N dynamics reduce projected losses of land C due to increasing temperature by 16\% (49 Pg C); however, this effect is prevalent only in mid-high latitude ecosystems. Despite synergistic interactions, the balance of these opposing effects is a significant reduction in future net land C storage. Terrestrial N dynamics thereby consistently increase atmospheric \{[\}CO2] in the year 2100 with a median value of 48 (41-55) ppmv, corresponding to an additional radiative forcing of 0.29 (0.28-0.34) W m(-2).

This paper focuses on the concentration\textendash{}carbon feedback in terrestrial ecosystems, analyzing the mechanisms and strength of the feedback reproduced by Earth system models (ESMs) participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. It is confirmed that multipleESMsdriven by acommonscenario show a large spread of concentration\textendash{}carbon feedback strength among models. Examining the behavior of the carbon fluxes and pools of the models showed that the sensitivity of plant productivity to elevated CO2 is likely the key to reduce the spread, although increasing CO2 stimulates other carbon cycle processes. Simulations with a singleESMdriven by differentCO2 pathways demonstrated that carbon accumulation increases in scenarios with slower CO2 increase rates. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, the study showed that the difference among CO2 scenarios is a time lag of terrestrial carbon pools in response to atmospheric CO2 increase\textemdash{}a high rate ofCO2 increase results in smaller carbon accumulations than that in an equilibriumstate of a givenCO2 concentration. These results demonstrate that the current quantities for concentration\textendash{}carbon feedback are incapable of capturing the feedback dependency on the carbon storage state and suggest that the concentration feedback can be larger for future scenarios where the CO2 growth rate is reduced. 1.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the future, the land system will be facing new intersecting challenges. While food demand, especially for resource-intensive livestock based commodities, is expected to increase, the terrestrial system has large potentials for climate change mitigation through improved agricultural management, providing biomass for bioenergy, and conserving or even enhancing carbon stocks of ecosystems. However, uncertainties in future socio-economic land use drivers may result in very different land-use dynamics and consequences for land-based ecosystem services. This is the first study with a systematic interpretation of the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) in terms of possible land-use changes and their consequences for the agricultural system, food provision and prices as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, five alternative Integrated Assessment Models with distinctive land-use modules have been used for the translation of the \{SSP\} narratives into quantitative projections. The model results reflect the general storylines of the \{SSPs\} and indicate a broad range of potential land-use futures with global agricultural land of 4900 mio ha in 2005 decreasing by 810 mio ha until 2100 at the lower (SSP1) and increasing by 1080 mio ha (SSP3) at the upper end. Greenhouse gas emissions from land use and land use change, as a direct outcome of these diverse land-use dynamics, and agricultural production systems differ strongly across \{SSPs\} (e.g. cumulative land use change emissions between 2005 and 2100 range from -54 to 402 Gt CO2). The inclusion of land-based mitigation efforts, particularly those in the most ambitious mitigation scenarios, further broadens the range of potential land futures and can strongly affect greenhouse gas dynamics and food prices. In general, it can be concluded that low demand for agricultural commodities, rapid growth in agricultural productivity and globalized trade, all most pronounced in a \{SSP1\} world, have the potential to enhance the extent of natural ecosystems, lead to lowest greenhouse gas emissions from the land system and decrease food prices over time. The SSP-based land use pathways presented in this paper aim at supporting future climate research and provide the basis for further regional integrated assessments, biodiversity research and climate impact analysis.},

  doi = {10.1007/s11367-015-0852-4},
  abstract = {Purpose: Numerous strategies have been implemented to reduce the global environmental burden of construction activities in order to achieve sustainable development goals. However, with regard to renovating and retrofitting existing buildings, life cycle assessment (LCA)-based studies mostly focus on the improvement of a building's energy performance rather than on the structural aspects of the retrofit itself. The present study assesses the life cycle environmental impacts of different replacement options for a typical old flat roof belonging to a masonry building. Three different structural options are considered: reinforced concrete joists and hollow clay blocks, steel joists and concrete slab, and reinforced concrete joists and polystyrene panels. Methods: The environmental analysis is based on a new approach wherein the structural and functional properties of a new flat roof are set as fixed requirements for the design of the different replacement options. A cradle-to-grave LCA-based study is then conducted for the environmental assessment of the entire retrofit process, including different waste scenarios. SimaPro software and IMPACT2002+ methodology are used for the LCA analysis, enabling quantification of the environmental impacts of the three flat roofing options by means of 4 endpoint and 15 midpoint indicators. Results and discussion: The environmental contribution of each life cycle phase related to the replacement of the old flat roof is assessed. The results demonstrate that within the life cycle of each option, the use phase and the construction phase have the highest environmental impact, ranging from 60 to 70 \{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} and 50 to 80 \{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of the total burden in the Climate Change/Resources and Human Health/Ecosystem Quality damage categories, respectively. Having initially set structural and functional constraints for the analysis, the results show that any of the different options exhibits an overall lowest environmental performance. Consequently, specific environmental burdens/categories can be identified to optimize the sustainable retrofit design. Conclusions and recommendations: The work demonstrates that a comprehensive LCA-based approach can be used to effectively drive the design of structural and functional retrofit operations on existing buildings. This study also shows how a rigorous environmental analysis, conducted by implementing the proposed approach, can influence decision-making for the most sustainable design alternatives. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Forest cover is interpreted from satellite imagery at 30m\texttimes{}30m resolution. Forest cover changes are then combined with pan-tropical biomass maps to estimate carbon losses. We show that there was a gross loss of tropical forests of 8.0 million ha y(-1) in the 1990s and 7.6 million ha y(-1) in the 2000s (0.49\% annual rate), with no statistically significant difference. Humid forests account for 64\% of the total forest cover in 2010 and 54\% of the net forest loss during second study decade. Losses of forest cover and other wooded land cover result in estimates of carbon losses which are similar for 1990s and 2000s at 887 MtC y(-1) (range: 646 - 1238) and 880 MtC y(-1) (range: 602 - 1237) respectively, with humid regions contributing two thirds. The estimates of forest area changes have small statistical standard errors due to large sample size. We also reduce uncertainties of previous estimates of carbon losses and removals. Our estimates of forest area change are significantly lower as compared to national survey data. We reconcile recent low estimates of carbon emissions from tropical deforestation for early 2000s and show that carbon loss rates did not change between the two last decades. Carbon losses from deforestation represent circa 10\% of Carbon emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production during the last decade (2000-2010). Our estimates of annual removals of carbon from forest regrowth at 115 MtC y(-1) (range: 61-168) and 97 MtC y(-1) (53-141) for the 1990s and 2000s respectively are five to fifteen times lower than earlier published estimates.

Concerns about climate change and energy security are driving an aggressive expansion of bioenergy crop production and many of these plant species emit more isoprene than the traditional crops they are replacing. Here we quantify the increases in isoprene emission rates caused by cultivation of 72 Mha of biofuel crops in Europe.

Yet the answer to this question remains enigmatic, as efforts to sample the world's biodiversity to date have been limited and thus have precluded direct quantification of global species richness, and because indirect estimates rely on assumptions that have proven highly controversial. Here we show that the higher taxonomic classification of species (i.e., the assignment of species to phylum, class, order, family, and genus) follows a consistent and predictable pattern from which the total number of species in a taxonomic group can be estimated. This approach was validated against well-known taxa, and when applied to all domains of life, it predicts $\sim$8.7 million ($\pm$1.3 million SE) eukaryotic species globally, of which $\sim$2.2 million ($\pm$0.18 million SE) are marine. In spite of 250 years of taxonomic classification and over 1.2 million species already catalogued in a central database, our results suggest that some 86\% of existing species on Earth and 91\% of species in the ocean still await description.

  abstract = {Life on Earth has repeatedly displayed abrupt and massive changes in the past, and there is no reason to expect that comparable planetary-scale regime shifts will not continue in the future. Different lines of evidence indicate that regime shifts occur when the climate or biosphere transgresses a tipping point. Whether human activities will trigger such a global event in the near future is uncertain, due to critical knowledge gaps. In particular, we lack understanding of how regime shifts propagate across scales, and whether local or regional tipping points can lead to global transitions. The ongoing disruption of ecosystems and climate, combined with unprecedented breakdown of isolation by human migration and trade, highlights the need to operate within safe planetary boundaries. \textcopyright{} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  volume = {20},
  issn = {0948-3349},
  doi = {10.1007/s11367-014-0815-1},
  abstract = {Purpose: Palm oil systems generate substantial amounts of biomass residues which are, according to best agricultural practices, preferably returned back to plantation in order to maintain soil fertility. However, there are often variations in this practice. Differences in economic status and possible treatment options for biomass residues determine the preferences to perform life cycle assessment (LCA), leading to a divergence in results. Difficulties when comparing LCA results based on literature are not unusual. The objectives of this paper are to provide guidelines for methodological choices that enable a systematic comparison of diverse scenarios for the treatment and valuation of empty fruit bunches (EFBs) and to explore effects of the scenarios on the environmental performances of a palm oil system.Methods: Eleven scenarios were selected to address the possible EFB valuation and expanded boundaries with reference to the main palm oil system (EFBs applied as mulch, converted to compost or ethanol, treated in an incinerator, and sold as coproducts). The life cycle inventories were modeled based upon an Ecoinvent database. Solutions to multifunctional problems were suggested, including the application of system expansion, substitution, and partitioning, depending upon the nature of the scenarios.Results and discussion: Comparison among LCA results based on the same multifunctional units (crude palm oil + palm kernel oil + palm kernel cake) can be accomplished only in cases where additional coproducts were utilized internally. Based on the global warming impact, the mulch option was preferred. The effect of the avoided process of producing synthetic fertilizers and the assumption that all parts of mulch are available as soil nutrient dominantly determined the final result. These need further verification. This study also demonstrates that the status of EFB as waste or goods is influential on the final results if the EFB is employed externally but has no effect if it is utilized internally.Conclusions: The proposed guidelines provide methodological choices in terms of system boundary, functional unit, and solutions to multifunctional problems. The methods can be used to systematically compare LCA results of different treatment options and valuation of EFB. The preferred alternative for managing this biomass residue could improve environmental performances and orient toward best practices, such as those suggested by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). Further studies incorporating a site-specific case of palm oil systems would better illustrate the usefulness of the proposed guidelines. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {The open vegetation corridor of South America is a region dominated by savanna biomes. It contains forests (i.e. riverine forests) that may act as corridors for rainforest specialists between the open vegetation corridor and its neighbouring biomes (i.e. the Amazonian and Atlantic forests). A prediction for this scenario is that populations of rainforest specialists in the open vegetation corridor and in the forested biomes show no significant genetic divergence. We addressed this hypothesis by studying plumage and genetic variation of the Planalto woodcreeper Dendrocolaptes platyrostris Spix (1824) (Aves: Furnariidae), a forest specialist that occurs in both open habitat and in the Atlantic forest. The study questions were: (1) is there any evidence of genetic continuity between populations of the open habitat and the Atlantic forest and (2) is plumage variation congruent with patterns of neutral genetic structure or with ecological factors related to habitat type? We used cytochrome b and mitochondrial DNA control region sequences to show that D. platyrostris is monophyletic and presents substantial intraspecific differentiation. We found two areas of plumage stability: one associated with Cerrado and the other associated with southern Atlantic Forest. Multiple Mantel tests showed that most of the plumage variation followed the transition of habitats but not phylogeographical gaps, suggesting that selection may be related to the evolution of the plumage of the species. The results were not compatible with the idea that forest specialists in the open vegetation corridor and in the Atlantic forest are linked at the population level because birds from each region were not part of the same genetic unit. Divergence in the presence of gene flow across the ecotone between both regions might explain our results. Also, our findings indicate that the southern Atlantic forest may have been significantly affected by Pleistocene climatic alteration, although such events did not cause local extinction of most taxa, as occurred in other regions of the globe where forests were significantly affected by global glaciations. Finally, our results neither support plumage stability areas, nor subspecies as full species. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2011 The Linnean Society of London.},

  abstract = {As an important parameter in recent and numerous environmental studies, soil moisture (SM) influences the exchange of water and energy at the interface between the land surface and atmosphere. Accurate estimate of the spatio-temporal variations of SM is critical for numerous large-scale terrestrial studies. Although microwave remote sensing provides many algorithms to obtain SM at large scale, such as SMOS and SMAP etc., resulting in many data products, they are almost low resolution and not applicable in small catchment or field scale. Estimations of SM from optical and thermal remote sensing have been studied for many years and significant progress has been made. In contrast to previous reviews, this paper presents a new, comprehensive and systematic review of using optical and thermal remote sensing for estimating SM. The physical basis and status of the estimation methods are analyzed and summarized in detail. The most important and latest advances in soil moisture estimation using temporal information have been shown in this paper. SM estimation from optical and thermal remote sensing mainly depends on the relationship between SM and the surface reflectance or vegetation index. The thermal infrared remote sensing methods uses the relationship between SM and the surface temperature or variations of surface temperature/vegetation index. These approaches often have complex derivation processes and many approximations. Therefore, combinations of optical and thermal infrared remotely sensed data can provide more valuable information for SM estimation. Moreover, the advantages and weaknesses of different approaches are compared and applicable conditions as well as key issues in current soil moisture estimation algorithms are discussed. Finally, key problems and suggested solutions are proposed for future research.},

Recent research has documented cases of regime shifts in local and regional systems and there is mounting concern about regime shifts of global significance. In this paper we discuss management of social-ecological systems in light of the potential for regime shift. Management that increases system resilience and lowers the probability of regime shifts is beneficial when regime shifts are likely to reduce human well-being. It may not always be possible to avoid harmful regime shifts, so building capacity to adapt should a regime shift occur is beneficial too. Adaptive management can help reduce uncertainty about the likelihood of regime shifts, how this likelihood can be affected by management action, and the impact of regime shifts on well-being. Linking scientific understanding with decision-making is important but distributional consequences can impede decision making and action. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Explanations for this fall broadly into two categories: bias in the fossil record and elevated net rates of diversification in recent periods. For example, the break up of Pangaea and isolation between continents might have increased net diversification rates. In this study, we investigate the effect on terrestrial diversification rates of the increased isolation between land masses brought about by continental drift. We use ecological neutral theory as a means to study geologically complex scenarios tractably. Our models show the effects of simulated geological events that affect all species equally, without the added complexity of further ecological processes.We find that continental drift leads to an increase in diversity only where isolation between continents leads to additional speciation through vicariance, and where higher taxa with very low global diversity are considered. We conclude that continental drift by itself is not sufficient to account for the increase in terrestrial species richness observed in the fossil record. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2016 The Authors.},

  abstract = {The size of the terrestrial sink remains uncertain. This uncertainty presents a challenge for projecting future climate-carbon cycle feedbacks(1-4). Terrestrial carbon storage is dependent on the availability of nitrogen for plant growth(5-8), and nitrogen limitation is increasingly included in global models(9-11). Widespread phosphorus limitation in terrestrial ecosystems(12) may also strongly regulate the global carbon cycle(13-15), but explicit considerations of phosphorus limitation in global models are uncommon(16). Here we use global state-of-the-art coupled carbon-climate model projections of terrestrial net primary productivity and carbon storage from 1860-2100; estimates of annual new nutrient inputs from deposition, nitrogen fixation, and weathering; and estimates of carbon allocation and stoichiometry to evaluate how simulated CO2 fertilization effects could be constrained by nutrient availability. We find that the nutrients required for the projected increases in net primary productivity greatly exceed estimated nutrient supply rates, suggesting that projected productivity increases may be unrealistically high. Accounting for nitrogen and nitrogen-phosphorus limitation lowers projected end-of-century estimates of net primary productivity by 19\% and 25\%, respectively, and turns the land surface into a net source of CO2 by 2100. We conclude that potential effects of nutrient limitation must be considered in estimates of the terrestrial carbon sink strength through the twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {The multi-plot flux-gradient (FG) technique is well-suited for non-intrusive measurements of agricultural N2O emissions for individually-treated field-scale plots across growing seasons at high temporal and spatial resolution. The degree of random error associated with N2O flux measurements is unknown; knowledge of these errors will increase confidence in the flux measurements and strengthen comparisons of total N2O emissions between treatments. An error estimation routine was developed to determine the random error ($\sigma$) associated with FG-measured fluxes ($\sigma$F). The combination of a moving-block bootstrapping technique and the filtering method of Salesky et al. (2012) estimated the $\sigma$ values for each variable used in calculating individual 30-min FG-derived fluxes. This error analysis was applied to a year-long dataset where a four-plot FG system measured N2O fluxes semi-continuously in a soybean field in Southwestern Ontario, Canada, with each plot having different treatments affecting N2O emissions. Errors of the concentration differences contributed the largest proportion to the $\sigma$Fvalues. The individual 30-min $\sigma$Fvalues did not correlate with the magnitude of the flux but were positively correlated with turbulence conditions. Random errors of N2O fluxes greater than 45 ng N m-2 s-1had values representative of 9\% of the measured flux, whereas error of fluxes close to zero frequently exceeded the value of the measured flux. Cumulating the errors over the experiment reduced the degree of error associated with the cumulated total N2O emissions with an average value of 31.5 g N ha-1, which represented on average $\pm$5.5\% of the total N2O emissions. The proposed framework is applicable to other scalar fluxes being determined by the flux-gradient method.},

  doi = {10.1002/ece3.877},
  abstract = {Large shifts in species ranges have been predicted under future climate scenarios based primarily on niche-based species distribution models. However, the mechanisms that would cause such shifts are uncertain. Natural and anthropogenic fires have shaped the distributions of many plant species, but their effects have seldom been included in future projections of species ranges. Here, we examine how the combination of climate and fire influence historical and future distributions of the ponderosa pine-prairie ecotone at the edge of the Black Hills in South Dakota, USA, as simulated by MC1, a dynamic global vegetation model that includes the effects of fire, climate, and atmospheric CO2 concentration on vegetation dynamics. For this purpose, we parameterized MC1 for ponderosa pine in the Black Hills, designating the revised model as MC1-WCNP. Results show that fire frequency, as affected by humidity and temperature, is central to the simulation of historical prairies in the warmer lowlands versus woodlands in the cooler, moister highlands. Based on three downscaled general circulation model climate projections for the 21st century, we simulate greater frequencies of natural fire throughout the area due to substantial warming for two of the climate projections, lower relative humidity. However, established ponderosa pine forests are relatively fire resistant, and areas that were initially wooded remained so over the 21st century for most of our future climate x fire management scenarios. This result contrasts with projections for ponderosa pine based on climatic niches, which suggest that its suitable habitat in the Black Hills will be greatly diminished by the middle of the 21st century. We hypothesize that the differences between the future predictions from these two approaches are due in part to the inclusion of fire effects in MC1, and we highlight the importance of accounting for fire as managed by humans in assessing both historical species distributions and future climate change effects. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2013 The Authors.},

  doi = {10.5194/esd-2017-121},
  abstract = {The consideration of gross land changes, meaning all area gains and losses within a pixel or administrative unit (e.g. country), plays an essential role in the estimation of total land changes. Gross land changes affect the magnitude of total land changes, which feeds back to the attribution of biogeochemical and biophysical processes related to climate change in Earth System Models. Global empirical studies on gross land changes are currently lacking. Whilst the relevance of gross changes for global change has been indicated in the literature, it is not accounted for in future land change scenarios. In this study, we extract gross and net land change dynamics from large-scale and high-resolution (30\&ndash;100\&thinsp;m) remote sensing products to create a new global gross and net change dataset. Subsequently, we developed an approach to integrate our empirically derived gross and net changes with the results of future simulation models, by accounting for the gross and net change addressed by the land use model and the gross and net change that is below the resolution of modelling. Based on our empirical data, we found that gross land change within 0.5-degree grid cells were substantially larger than net changes in all parts of the world. As 0.5-degree grid cells are a standard resolution of Earth System Models, this leads to an underestimation of the amount of change. This finding contradicts earlier studies, which assumed gross land changes to appear in shifting cultivation areas only. Applied in a future scenario, the consideration of gross land changes led to approximately 50\&thinsp;\% more land changes globally compared to a net land change representation. Gross land changes were most important in heterogeneous land systems with multiple land uses (e.g. shifting cultivation, smallholder farming, and agro-forestry systems). Moreover, the importance of gross changes decreased over time due to further polarization and intensification of land use. Our results serve as empirical database for land change dynamics that can be applied in Earth System Models and Integrated Assessment Models.},

  abstract = {Animal products, i.e. meat, milk and eggs, provide an important component in global diets, but livestock dominate agricultural land use by area and are a major source of greenhouse gases. Cultural and personal associations with animal product consumption create barriers to moderating consumption, and hence reduced environmental impacts. Here we review alternatives to conventional animal products, including cultured meat, imitation meat and insects (i.e. entomophagy), and explore the potential change in global agricultural land requirements associated with each alternative. Stylised transformative consumption scenarios where half of current conventional animal products are substituted to provide at least equal protein and calories are considered. The analysis also considers and compares the agricultural land area given shifts between conventional animal product consumption. The results suggest that imitation meat and insects have the highest land use efficiency, but the land use requirements are only slightly greater for eggs and poultry meat. The efficiency of insects and their ability to convert agricultural by-products and food waste into food, suggests further research into insect production is warranted. Cultured meat does not appear to offer substantial benefits over poultry meat or eggs, with similar conversion efficiency, but higher direct energy requirements. Comparison with the land use savings from reduced consumer waste, including over-consumption, suggests greater benefits could be achieved from alternative dietary transformations considered. We conclude that although a diet with lower rates of animal product consumption is likely to create the greatest reduction in agricultural land, a mix of smaller changes in consumer behaviour, such as replacing beef with chicken, reducing food waste and potentially introducing insects more commonly into diets, would also achieve land savings and a more sustainable food system.},

Global warming and climate change, as driving forces of sea level rise, tend to increase such submersion periods and also modify the carbonate chemistry of the water column due to the increased concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. In the present work, the underwater O2 fluxes in the leaves of two abundant Mediterranean halophytes were evaluated at different levels of dissolved CO2. Photosynthetic enhancement due to increased dissolved CO2 was confirmed for both Halimione portulacoides and Spartina maritima, probably due to high tissue porosity, formation of leaf gas films and reduction of the oxygenase activity of Rubisco. Enhancement of the photosynthetic rates in H. portulacoides and S. maritima was concomitant with an increase in energy trapping and transfer, mostly due to enhancement of the carboxylation reaction of Rubisco, leading to a reduction of the energy costs for carbon fixation.

  abstract = {Physical and biogeochemical processes regulate soil carbon dynamics and CO2 flux to and from the atmosphere, influencing global climate changes. Integration of these processes into Earth system models (e.g., community land models (CLMs)), however, currently faces three major challenges: (1) extensive efforts are required to modify modeling structures and to rewrite computer programs to incorporate new or updated processes as new knowledge is being generated, (2) computational cost is prohibitively expensive to simulate biogeochemical processes in land models due to large variations in the rates of biogeochemical processes, and (3) various mathematical representations of biogeochemical processes exist to incorporate different aspects of fundamental mechanisms, but systematic evaluation of the different mathematical representations is difficult, if not impossible. To address these challenges, we propose a new computational framework to easily incorporate physical and biogeochemical processes into land models. The new framework consists of a new biogeochemical module, Next Generation BioGeoChemical Module (NGBGC), version 1.0, with a generic algorithm and reaction database so that new and updated processes can be incorporated into land models without the need to manually set up the ordinary differential equations to be solved numerically. The reaction database consists of processes of nutrient flow through the terrestrial ecosystems in plants, litter, and soil. This framework facilitates effective comparison studies of biogeochemical cycles in an ecosystem using different conceptual models under the same land modeling framework. The approach was first implemented in CLM and benchmarked against simulations from the original CLM-CN code. A case study was then provided to demonstrate the advantages of using the new approach to incorporate a phosphorus cycle into CLM. To our knowledge, the phosphorus-incorporated CLM is a new model that can be used to simulate phosphorus limitation on the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. The method presented here could in theory be applied to simulate biogeochemical cycles in other Earth system models. \textcopyright{} 2013 Author(s). CC Attribution 3.0 License.},

  abstract = {A pollinator decline caused by environmental degradation might be compromising the production of pollinator-dependent crops. In a recent article, we compared 45 year series (1961-2006) in yield, production and cultivated area of pollinator-dependent and nondependent crop around the world. If pollinator shortage is occurring globally, we expected a lower annual growth rate in yield for pollinator-dependent than nondependent crops, but a higher growth in cultivated area to compensate the lower yield. We have found little evidence for the first \{"\}yield\{"\} prediction but strong evidence for the second \{"\}area\{"\} prediction. Here, we present an additional analysis to show that the first and second predictions are both supported for crops that vary in dependency levels from nondependent to moderate dependence (i.e., up to 65\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} average yield reduction without pollinators). However, those crops for which animal pollination is essential (i.e., 95\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} average yield reduction without pollinators) showed higher growth in yield and lower expansion in area than expected in a pollination shortage scenario. We propose that pollination management for highly pollinator-dependent crops, such us renting hives or hand pollination, might have compensated for pollinator limitation of yield. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\}2009 Landes Bioscience.},

  abstract = {Understanding uncertainties in land cover projections is critical to investigating land-based climate mitigation policies, assessing the potential of climate adaptation strategies and quantifying the impacts of land cover change on the climate system. Here, we identify and quantify uncertainties in global and European land cover projections over a diverse range of model types and scenarios, extending the analysis beyond the agro-economic models included in previous comparisons. The results from 75 simulations over 18 models are analysed and show a large range in land cover area projections, with the highest variability occurring in future cropland areas. We demonstrate systematic differences in land cover areas associated with the characteristics of the modelling approach, which is at least as great as the differences attributed to the scenario variations. The results lead us to conclude that a higher degree of uncertainty exists in land use projections than currently included in climate or earth system projections. To account for land use uncertainty, it is recommended to use a diverse set of models and approaches when assessing the potential impacts of land cover change on future climate. Additionally, further work is needed to better understand the assumptions driving land use model results and reveal the causes of uncertainty in more depth, to help reduce model uncertainty and improve the projections of land cover.},

Distinct regional trends in response to projected climatic change were evident across all combinations of the experimental factors. In the eastern half of the U.S., the average response to relatively large increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation was an 11\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} loss of total ecosystem carbon. In the West, the response to increases in precipitation and relatively small increases in temperature was a 5\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} increase in total carbon stocks. Simulated fire suppression reduced average carbon losses in the East to about 6\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\}, and preserved forests which were largely converted to woodland and savanna in the absence of fire suppression. Across the west, unsuppressed fire maintained near constant carbon stocks despite increases in vegetation productivity. With fire suppression, western carbon stocks increased by 10\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} and most shrublands were converted to woodland or even forest. With a relatively high level of growth in response to CO2, total ecosystem carbon pools at the end of the century were on average about 9-10\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} larger in both regions of the U.S. compared to a low CO2 response. The western U.S. gained enough carbon to counter losses from unsuppressed fire only with the high CO2 response, especially in conjunction with the higher CO2 emission rate. In the eastern U.S., fire suppression was sufficient to produce a simulated carbon sink only with both the high CO2 response and emission rate. Considerable uncertainty exists with respect to the impacts of global warming on the ecosystems of the conterminous U.S., some of which resides in the future trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions, in the direct response of vegetation to increasing CO2, and in future tradeoffs among different fire management options, as illustrated in this study. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2008 Elsevier B.V.},

It does so by embedding the Thunian model of location rents within the regime of capital accumulation that has driven the Brazilian economy since the mid-20th century. The paper addresses policies that have created location rents in Amaz\^onia, the effect of these rents on land managers, and the spatial implications of their behavior on forests. Thus, the paper connects macro-processes and structures to agents on the ground, in providing a political ecological explanation relevant to land change science. The policy discussion focuses on reductions in transportation costs, improvements in animal health, and monetary and trade reforms. To illustrate the impact of policy, the paper presents data on the geography of Amazonian herd expansion, on the growth of Amazonian exports, and on the profitability of the region's cattle economy. It follows the empirical presentation with more abstract consideration of the spatial relations between cattle ranching and soy farming, and implications for deforestation. The paper concludes on a speculative note by considering the likelihood of forest transition in the region, given the transformation of Amaz\^onia into a global resource frontier. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In the Ricardian view, it becomes economically feasible to bring marginal land into use as prices of land-based commodities increase. Even though the stock of suitable land is finite, a geographic redistribution of land use, trade, and investments in land resources give access to more resources, but it comes at ever increasing economic, environmental and social costs.

Tropical forests exchange more C, energy, and water with the atmosphere than any other class of land ecosystems. Further, tropical-forest C cycling is likely responding to the rapid global warming, intensifying water stress, and increasing atmospheric CO2 levels. Projections of the future C balance of the tropics vary widely among global models. A current effort of the modeling community, the ILAMB (International Land Model Benchmarking) project, is to compile robust observations that can be used to improve the accuracy and realism of the land models for all major biomes. Our goal with this paper is to identify field observations of tropical-forest ecosystem C stocks and fluxes, and of their long-term trends and climatic and CO2 sensitivities, that can serve this effort. We propose criteria for reference-level field data from this biome and present a set of documented examples from old-growth lowland tropical forests. We offer these as a starting point towards the goal of a regularly updated consensus set of benchmark field observations of C cycling in tropical forests.},

The extent to which flowering-time response to temperature is shared among closely related species might have important consequences for community-wide patterns of species loss under rapid climate change. Henry David Thoreau initiated a dataset of the Concord, Massachusetts, flora that spans approximately 150 years and provides information on changes in species abundance and flowering time. When these data are analyzed in a phylogenetic context, they indicate that change in abundance is strongly correlated with flowering-time response. Species that do not respond to temperature have decreased greatly in abundance, and include among others anemones and buttercups [Ranunculaceae pro parte (p.p.)], asters and campanulas (Asterales), bluets (Rubiaceae p.p.), bladderworts (Lentibulariaceae), dogwoods (Cornaceae), lilies (Liliales), mints (Lamiaceae p.p.), orchids (Orchidaceae), roses (Rosaceae p.p.), saxifrages (Saxifragales), and violets (Malpighiales).

  abstract = {Although climate acts as a fundamental constraint on the distribution of organisms, understanding how this relationship between climate and distribution varies over a species' range is critical for addressing the potential impacts of accelerated climate change on biodiversity. Bioclimatic niche models provide compelling evidence that many species will experience range shifts under scenarios of global change, yet these broad, macroecological perspectives lack specificity at local scales, where unique combinations of environment, biota, and history conspire against generalizations. We explored how these idiosyncrasies of place affect the climate-distribution relationship of the American pika (Ochotona princeps) by replicating intensive field surveys across bioclimatic gradients in eight U.S. national parks. At macroecological scales, the importance of climate as a constraint on pika distribution appears unequivocal; forecasts suggest that the species' range will contract sharply in coming decades. However, the species persists outside of its modeled bioclimatic envelope in many locations, fueling uncertainty and debate over its conservation status. Using a Bayesian hierarchical approach, we modeled variation in local patterns of pika distribution along topographic position, vegetation cover, elevation, temperature, and precipitation gradients in each park landscape. We also accounted for annual turnover in site occupancy probabilities. Topographic position and vegetation cover influenced occurrence in all parks. After accounting for these factors, pika occurrence varied widely among parks along bioclimatic gradients. Precipitation by itself was not a particularly influential predictor. However, measures of heat stress appeared most influential in the driest parks, suggesting an interaction between the strength of climate effects and the position of parks along precipitation gradients. The combination of high elevation, cold temperatures, and high precipitation lowered occurrence probabilities in some parks, suggesting an upper elevational limit for pikas in some environments. Our results demonstrate that the idiosyncrasies of place influence both the nature and strength of the climate-distribution relationship for the American pika. Fine-grained, but geographically extensive, studies replicated across multiple landscapes offer insights important to assessing the impacts of climate change that otherwise may be masked at macroecological scales. The hierarchical approach to modeling provides a coherent conceptual and technical framework for gaining these insights.},

Here, we combine spatially explicit projections of urban expansion with datasets on global croplands and crop yields. Our results show that urban expansion will result in a 1.8-2.4\% loss of global croplands by 2030, with substantial regional disparities. About 80\% of global cropland loss from urban expansion will take place in Asia and Africa. In both Asia and Africa, much of the cropland that will be lost is more than twice as productive as national averages. Asia will experience the highest absolute loss in cropland, whereas African countries will experience the highest percentage loss of cropland. Globally, the croplands that are likely to be lost were responsible for 3-4\% of worldwide crop production in 2000. Urban expansion is expected to take place on cropland that is 1.77 times more productive than the global average. The loss of cropland is likely to be accompanied by other sustainability risks and threatens livelihoods, with diverging characteristics for different megaurban regions. Governance of urban area expansion thus emerges as a key area for securing livelihoods in the agrarian economies of the Global South.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is estimated to produce more than 40\% of anthropogenic methane (CH4) emissions, contributing to global climate change. Bottom-up, IPCC based methodologies are typically used to estimate the agriculture sector's contribution, but these estimates are rarely verified beyond the farm gate, due to the challenge of separating interspersed sources. We present flux measurements of CH4using eddy covariance (EC), relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) and wavelet covariance obtained using an aircraft-based measurement platform and compare these top-down estimates with bottom-up footprint adjusted inventory estimates of CH4emissions for an agricultural region in eastern Ontario, Canada. Top-down CH4fluxes agree well (mean $\pm$ 1 standard error: EC = 17 $\pm$ 4 mg CH4m-2d-1; REA = 19 $\pm$ 3 mg CH4m-2d-1, wavelet covariance = 16 $\pm$ 3 mg CH4m-2d-1), and are not statistically different, but significantly exceed bottom-up inventory estimates of CH4emissions based on animal husbandry (8 $\pm$ 1 mg CH4m-2d-1). The discrepancy between top-down and bottom-up estimates was found to be related to both increasing fractional area of wetlands in the flux footprint, and increasing surface temperature. For the case when the wetland area in the flux footprint was less than 10\% fractional coverage, the top-down and bottom-up estimates were within the measurement error. This result provides the first independent verification of agricultural methane emissions inventories at the regional scale. Wavelet analysis, which provides spatially resolved fluxes, was used to attempt to separate CH4emissions from managed and unmanaged CH4sources. Opportunities to minimize the challenges of verifying agricultural CH4emissions inventories using aircraft flux measuring systems are discussed.},

  abstract = {A dynamic model is constructed for interactive silicon, nitrogen, sulfur
processing in and below Arctic sea ice, by ecosystems residing in the
lower few centimeters of the distributed pack. A biogeochemically active
bottom layer supporting sources/sinks for the pennate diatoms is
appended to thickness categories of a global sea ice code. Nutrients
transfer from the ocean mixed layer to drive algal growth, while sulfur
metabolites are reinjected from the ice interface. Freeze, flux, flush
and melt processes are linked to multielement geocycling for the entire
high-latitude regime. Major element kinetics are optimized initially to
reproduce chlorophyll observations, which extend across the seasons.
Principal influences on biomass are solute exchange velocity at the
solid interface, optical averaging in active ice and cell retention
against ablation. The sulfur mechanism encompasses open water features
such as accumulation of particulate dimethyl sulfoniopropionate, grazing
and other disruptive releases, plus bacterial/enzymatic conversion to
volatile dimethyl sulfide. For baseline settings, the mixed layer trace
gas distribution matches sparging measurements where they are available.
However, concentrations rise to well over 10 nM in remote, unsampled
locations. Peak contributions are supported by ice grazing, mortality
and fractional melting. The model bottom layer adds substantially to a
ring maximum of reduced sulfur chemistry that may be dominant across the
marginal Arctic environment. Sensitivity tests on this scenario include
variation of cell sulfur composition and remineralization,
routings/chemical time scales, and the physical dimension of water
layers. An alternate possibility that peripheral additions are small
cannot be excluded from the outcomes. It is concluded that seagoing
dimethyl sulfide data are far too sparse at the present time to
distinguish sulfur-ice production levels. Citation: Elliott, S., C.

  abstract = {The ecosystem model OSMOSE-WFS was employed to evaluate natural mortality rates and fishing scenarios for Gulf of Mexico (GOM) red grouper (Epinephelus morio). OSMOSE-WFS represents major high trophic level (HTL) groups of species of the West Florida Shelf, is forced by the biomass of plankton and benthos groups, and has a monthly time step. The present application of the model uses a recently developed 'stochastic mortality algorithm' to resolve the mortality processes of HTL groups. OSMOSE-WFS predictions suggest that the natural mortality rate of juveniles of GOM red grouper is high and essentially due to predation, while the bulk of the natural mortality of adult red grouper results from causes not represented in OSMOSE-WFS such as, presumably, red tides. These results were communicated to GOM red grouper stock assessments. Moreover, OSMOSE-WFS indicate that altering the fishing mortality of GOM red grouper may have no global impact on the biomass of the major prey of red grouper, due to the high complexity and high redundancy of the modeled system. By contrast, altering the fishing mortality of GOM red grouper may have a large impact on the biomass of its major competitors. Increasing the fishing mortality of red grouper would increase the biomass of major competitors, due to reduced competition for food. Conversely, decreasing the fishing mortality of red grouper would diminish the biomass of major competitors, due to increased predation pressure on the juveniles of the major competitors by red grouper. The fishing scenarios that we evaluated may have slightly different impacts in the real world, due to some discrepancies between the diets of red grouper and its major competitors predicted by OSMOSE-WFS and the observed ones. Modifications in OSMOSE-WFS are suggested to reduce these discrepancies. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Due to human population growth and migration, there will be nearly 2 billion new urban residents by 2030, yet the consequences of both current and future urbanization for biodiversity conservation are poorly known. Here we show that urban growth will have impacts on ecoregions, rare species, and protected areas that are localized but cumulatively significant. Currently, 29 of the world's 825 ecoregions have over one-third of their area urbanized, and these 29 ecoregions are the only home of 213 endemic terrestrial vertebrate species. Our analyses suggest that 8\% of terrestrial vertebrate species on the IUCN Red List are imperiled largely because of urban development. By 2030, 15 additional ecoregions are expected to lose more than 5\% of their remaining undeveloped area, and they contain 118 vertebrate species found nowhere else. Of the 779 rare species with only one known population globally, 24 are expected to be impacted by urban growth. In addition, the distance between protected areas and cities is predicted to shrink dramatically in some regions: for example, the median distance from a protected area to a city in Eastern Asia is predicted to fall from 43 km to 23 km by 2030. Most protected areas likely to be impacted by new urban growth (88\%) are in countries of low to moderate income, potentially limiting institutional capacity to adapt to new anthropogenic stresses on protected areas. In short, trends in global ecoregions, rare species, and protected areas suggest localized but significant biodiversity degradation associated with current and upcoming urbanization. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Corallimorpharia is a small Order of skeleton-less animals that is closely related to the reef-building corals (Scleractinia) and of fundamental interest in the context of understanding the potential impacts of climate change in the future on coral reefs. The relationship between the nominal Orders Corallimorpharia and Scleractinia is controversial the former is either the closest outgroup to the Scleractinia or alternatively is derived from corals via skeleton loss. This latter scenario, the \{"\}naked coral\{"\} hypothesis, is strongly supported by analyses based on mitochondrial (mt) protein sequences, whereas the former is equally strongly supported by analyses of mt nucleotide sequences. The \{"\}naked coral\{"\} hypothesis seeks to link skeleton loss in the putative ancestor of corallimorpharians with a period of elevated oceanic CO2 during the Cretaceous, leading to the idea that these skeleton-less animals may be harbingers for the fate of coral reefs under global climate change. In an attempt to better understand their evolutionary relationships, we examined mt genome organization in a representative range (12 species, representing 3 of the 4 extant families) of corallimorpharians and compared these patterns with other Hexacorallia. The most surprising finding was that mt genome organization in Corallimorphusprofundus, a deep-water species that is the most scleractinian-like of all corallimorpharians on the basis of morphology, was much more similar to the common scieractinian pattern than to those of other corallimorpharians. This finding is consistent with the idea that C. profundus represents a key position in the coral - corallimorpharian transition. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2014 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {1. Understanding how plants respond and adapt to varying environmental conditions has attracted the attention of plant ecologists for decades. To study this process, altitudinal gradients are used because of their inherent variation in environmental conditions. In the current scenario of global warming, altitudinal gradients may also represent a valuable resource to deepen our understanding about plant adaptive responses to predicted changes in environmental conditions. 2. Nowadays, the study of adaptive variation demands equal contributions from ecology and genetics. We need to assess the effects of selective pressures on phenotypic variation but also the genetic and molecular basis of phenotypic traits. The annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana represents a useful model system for investigating adaptive variation. Here, I characterized patterns of life cycle variation in natural A. thaliana populations along an altitudinal gradient to unravel how the species copes with different environmental conditions. 3. I periodically monitored thousands of plants from eight populations in NE Spain over 5 years (20072011) to estimate survival and fecundity schedules for autumn- and spring-germinated plants. Data were used to estimate net reproductive rate for each life cycle type. Data were regressed against altitude to detect altitudinal climatic clines for life cycle variation. 4. Survival of spring-germinated A. thaliana plants was significantly higher than that of winter-germinated plants. Plants from both cohorts exhibited similar fecundity values. The net reproductive rate of spring-germinated plants was fourfold higher than that of autumn-germinated plants. The proportion of spring-germinated plants increased significantly with altitude. 5. Synthesis. Arabidopsis thaliana can behave as a winter or spring annual plant. Nevertheless, the spring annual life cycle is clearly relevant to maintain A. thaliana populations, particularly at high-elevation locations. It is suggested that germination timing represents one of the most relevant traits to focus our efforts to understand adaptive variation in A. thaliana. The results illustrate the potential of annual plants to adjust their life cycles to varying environmental conditions encountered along a climatic gradient, which could mitigate the effects of global warming on annual plant populations.},

  abstract = {Observations on glacier extent from Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia give a detailed and unequivocal account of rapid shrinkage of tropical Andean glaciers since the Little Ice Age (LIA). This retreat however, was not continuous but interrupted by several periods of stagnant or even advancing glaciers, most recently around the end of the 20th century. New data from mass balance networks established on over a dozen glaciers allows comparison of the glacier behavior in the inner and outer tropics. It appears that glacier variations are quite coherent throughout the region, despite different sensitivities to climatic forcing such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, etc. In parallel with the glacier retreat, climate in the tropical Andes has changed significantly over the past 50-60~years. Temperature in the Andes has increased by approximately 0.1~$^\circ$C/decade, with only two of the last 20~years being below the 1961-90 average. Precipitation has slightly increased in the second half of the 20th century in the inner tropics and decreased in the outer tropics. The general pattern of moistening in the inner tropics and drying in the subtropical Andes is dynamically consistent with observed changes in the large-scale circulation, suggesting a strengthening of the tropical atmospheric circulation. Model projections of future climate change in the tropical Andes indicate a continued warming of the tropical troposphere throughout the 21st century, with a temperature increase that is enhanced at higher elevations. By the end of the 21st century, following the SRES A2 emission scenario, the tropical Andes may experience a massive warming on the order of 4.5-5~$^\circ$C. Predicted changes in precipitation include an increase in precipitation during the wet season and a decrease during the dry season, which would effectively enhance the seasonal hydrological cycle in the tropical Andes. These observed and predicted changes in climate affect the tropical glacier energy balance through its sensitivity to changes in atmospheric humidity (which governs sublimation), precipitation (whose variability induces a positive feedback on albedo) and cloudiness (which controls the incoming long-wave radiation). In the inner tropics air temperature also significantly influences the energy balance, albeit not through the sensible heat flux, but indirectly through fluctuations in the rain-snow line and hence changes in albedo and net radiation receipts. Given the projected changes in climate, based on different IPCC scenarios for 2050 and 2080, simulations with a tropical glacier-climate model indicate that glaciers will continue to retreat. Many smaller, low-lying glaciers are already completely out of equilibrium with current climate and will disappear within a few decades. But even in catchments where glaciers do not completely disappear, the change in streamflow seasonality, due to the reduction of the glacial buffer during the dry season, will significantly affect the water availability downstream. In the short-term, as glaciers retreat and lose mass, they add to a temporary increase in runoff to which downstream users will quickly adapt, thereby raising serious sustainability concerns. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We show a persistent and widespread increase of growing season integrated LAI (greening) over 25\% to 50\% of the global vegetated area, whereas less than 4\% of the globe shows decreasing LAI (browning).

CO2 fertilization eects explain most of the greening trends in the tropics, whereas climate change resulted in greening of the high latitudes and the Tibetan Plateau. LCC contributed most to the regional greening observed in southeast China and the eastern United States.

This article first reviews some of the useful theories analyzing how environmental change can have a feedback effect on behaviors, via the environmental cognitions. Then, it discusses three propositions for more cognitively realistic agents in land change science: (i) land use choices result from multiple decision-making processes and rely on various motives, influenced by social norms, emotions, beliefs, and values toward the environment; (ii) social-ecological feedbacks are mediated by the environmental cognitions, that is, the perception, interpretation, evaluation of environmental change, and decision-making; (iii) human agents actively re-evaluate their beliefs, values, and functioning to adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Empirical and modeling studies in land change science can progress by linking the three components of the feedback loop, that is, environmental changes, environmental cognitions, and land use practices.},

  abstract = {The consequences of climate change, including changes in the frequency and violence of extreme weather events and changing precipitation patterns are expected to have large impacts on peoples livelihoods, especially in poor and vulnerable rural societies. In many of these societies migration has already been a livelihood strategy for generations. Shocks and stresses evoked by the consequences of a changing climate that threaten peoples livelihoods are therefore also likely to have impacts on their migratory behaviour. Migration might increase as people need to search for a living elsewhere. But it might as well decrease as fewer people can afford to move. It is also conceivable that migrants choose different destinations that they perceive as more appropriate for their changing needs. Despite the growing awareness of the nexus between climate change and migration the subject has not been explored empirically in a way that generates conclusive results. In this, we outline the key elements of natural and human-induced climate change of potential relevance to migration; discuss the current state of the debate about the relationship between climate change and migration and describe approaches with which to further our understanding of climate change-related migration. Climate change and variability can occur as a result of natural processes and due to human activity. Human induced climate change over the last century arises primarily from the alteration of atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases by the burning of fossil fuels and change of land use. Volcanic eruptions and variations in solar activity are the major processes causing natural climate change over the same timescales. The consensus view, as expressed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is that an increase in greenhouse gases brought about by human activity is the main culprit for climate change since the mid 20th century. Predicting future climate change is inherently uncertain due to a lack of information on known climate system processes, a lack of knowledge of all of the climate processes that affect the climate system and the chaotic nature of the atmosphere. The IPCC provide comprehensive assessments of the scientific, technical and socio-economic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis of risk of human-induced climate change, its potential impacts and options for adaptation and mitigation. The latest batch of IPCC reports, released in February 2007, predicts temperature increases throughout the globe, with these being greatest over land and high latitudes in the northern hemisphere in the winter. On the continents, warming is projected to increase from the coasts to the interiors and be typically larger in arid compared to moist regions...},

This challenge for developing countries confronts the force of economic globalization, which seeks cropland that is shrinking in availability and triggers deforestation. Four mechanisms-the displacement, rebound, cascade, and remittance effects-that are amplified by economic globalization accelerate land conversion. A few developing countries have managed a land use transition over the recent decades that simultaneously increased their forest cover and agricultural production. These countries have relied on various mixes of agricultural intensification, land use zoning, forest protection, increased reliance on imported food and wood products, the creation of off-farm jobs, foreign capital investments, and remittances. Sound policies and innovations can therefore reconcile forest preservation with food production. Globalization can be harnessed to increase land use efficiency rather than leading to uncontrolled land use expansion. To do so, land systems should be understood and modeled as open systems with large flows of goods, people, and capital that connect local land use with global-scale factors.},

Climate change also exacerbates local stresses from declining water quality and overexploitation of key species, driving reefs increasingly toward the tipping point for functional collapse. This review presents future scenarios for coral reefs that predict increasingly serious consequences for reef-associated fisheries, tourism, coastal protection, and people. As the International Year of the Reef 2008 begins, scaled-up management intervention and decisive action on global emissions are required if the loss of coral-dominated ecosystems is to be avoided.},

  title = {Secondary {{School Students}}' {{Environmental Concerns}} and {{Attitudes}} toward {{Forest Ecosystem Services}}: {{Implications}} for {{Biodiversity Education OPEN ACCESS}}},
  abstract = {Alarming declines in biodiversity have encouraged scientists to begin promoting the idea of the services ecosystems offer to humans in order to gain support for conservation. The concept of ecosystem services is designed to communicate societal dependence on various natural ecosystems. Schools play an important role in educating students to be active and responsible towards the environment. A questionnaire testing for the influence of different types of environmental concern on attitudes to forest ecosystem services was completed by 410 Slovenian secondary school students in northwestern Slovenia. The students' attitudes to forest ecosystem services were investigated via 15 statements about provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural services. The student's environmental concern was investigated using a questionnaire of 12 items. Results from the survey provide evidence that students' concerns for the consequences of environmental damage formed three correlated factors centred around the self and family, all people and the biosphere. Students' most highly valued environmental concern was for the biosphere, followed by concern for self and family, and concern for all the people. Female students were notably more concerned for all people and for the biosphere. However, all students, regardless of the type of environmental concern, prioritise the different benefits obtained from regulating and supporting ecosystem services. The importance placed on different provisioning and cultural services varies among students with different types of environmental concerns. The students' frequency of direct experiences being in the forest has a significant positive impact on the values they assigned to cultural services in particular. Education about ecosystem services could be an effective means of communicating the significance of various ecosystems and our dependence on ecological life support systems. By using ecosystem services frameworks students can learn about and value ecosystem structure and functions, as well as better evaluate human activities that are associated with them. Using ecosystem services frameworks and elaborated types of environmental concerns can help educators emphasize the attitudes/needs/rights of an individual and of a society to discuss these socio-scientific issues in a cooperative learning environment. Biodiversity education should not overlook cultural ecosystem services and address them in terms of changing human values and sustainability.},

  abstract = {Policies to control emissions of criteria pollutants in China may have conflicting impacts on public health, soil acidification, and climate. Two scenarios for 2020, a base case without anticipated control measures and a more realistic case including such controls, are evaluated to quantify the effects of the policies on emissions and resulting environmental outcomes. Large benefits to public health can be expected from the controls, attributed mainly to reduced emissions of primary PM and gaseous PM precursors, and thus lower ambient concentrations of PM2.5. Approximately 4\% of all-cause mortality in the country can be avoided (95\% confidence interval: 1-7\%), particularly in eastern and north-central China, regions with large population densities and high levels of PM2.5. Surface ozone levels, however, are estimated to increase in parts of those regions, despite NOX reductions. This implies VOC-limited conditions. Even with significant reduction of SO2 and NOX emissions, the controls will not significantly mitigate risks of soil acidification, judged by the exceedance levels of critical load (CL). This is due to the decrease in primary PM emissions, with the consequent reduction in deposition of alkaline base cations. Compared to 2005, even larger CL exceedances are found for both scenarios in 2020, implying that PM control may negate any recovery from soil acidification due to SO2 reductions. Noting large uncertainties, current polices to control emissions of criteria pollutants in China will not reduce climate warming, since controlling SO2 emissions also reduces reflective secondary aerosols. Black carbon emission is an important source of uncertainty concerning the effects of Chinese control policies on global temperature change. Given these conflicts, greater consideration should be paid to reconciling varied environmental objectives, and emission control strategies should target not only criteria pollutants but also species such as VOCs and CO2.},

In 5 of 10 well-studied ecosystems, the average exploitation rate has recently declined and is now at or below the rate predicted to achieve maximum sustainable yield for seven systems. Yet 63\% of assessed fish stocks worldwide still require rebuilding, and even lower exploitation rates are needed to reverse the collapse of vulnerable species. Combined fisheries and conservation objectives can be achieved by merging diverse management actions, including catch restrictions, gear modification, and closed areas, depending on local context. Impacts of international fleets and the lack of alternatives to fishing complicate prospects for rebuilding fisheries in many poorer regions, highlighting the need for a global perspective on rebuilding marine resources.},

Data supported narrative descriptions within STMs are used to select or justify management actions. State transitions are characteristically heterogeneous in space and time, but spatial heterogeneity is seldom described in STMs, thereby limiting their utility. 2.We conducted a review that indicates how spatially explicit data can be used to improve STMs. We first identified three spatial scales at which spatial patterns and processes are manifest: patches, sites and landscapes. We then identified three classes of spatial processes that govern heterogeneity in state transitions at each scale and that can be considered in empirical studies, STM narratives and management interpretations. 3.First, spatial variations in land-use driver history (e.g. grazing use) can explain differences in the occurrence of state transitions within land areas that are otherwise uniform. Secondly, spatial dependence in response to drivers imposed by variations in soils, landforms and climate can explain how the likelihood of state transition varies along relatively static environmental gradients. Thirdly, state transition processes can be contagious, under control of vegetation-environment feedbacks, such that the spatiotemporal evolution of state transitions is predictable. 4.We suggest a strategy for considering each of the three spatial processes in the development of STM narratives. We illustrate how spatial data can be employed for describing early warning indicators of state transition, identifying areas that are most susceptible to state transitions, and designing and implementing monitoring schemes. 5.Synthesis and applications. State-and-transition models are increasingly important tools for guiding land-management activities. However, failure to adequately represent spatial processes in STMs can limit their ability to identify the initiation, risk and causes of state transitions and, therefore, the appropriate management responses. We suggest that multi-scaled studies targeted to different kinds of ecosystems can be used to uncover evidence of spatial processes. Such evidence should be included in STM narratives and can lead to novel interpretations of land change and improved management.},

  abstract = {Mangrove ecosystems are threatened by climate change. We review the state of knowledge of mangrove vulnerability and responses to predicted climate change and consider adaptation options. Based on available evidence, of all the climate change outcomes, relative sea-level rise may be the greatest threat to mangroves. Most mangrove sediment surface elevations are not keeping pace with sea-level rise, although longer term studies from a larger number of regions are needed. Rising sea-level will have the greatest impact on mangroves experiencing net lowering in sediment elevation, where there is limited area for landward migration. The Pacific Islands mangroves have been demonstrated to be at high risk of substantial reductions. There is less certainty over other climate change outcomes and mangrove responses. More research is needed on assessment methods and standard indicators of change in response to effects from climate change, while regional monitoring networks are needed to observe these responses to enable educated adaptation. Adaptation measures can offset anticipated mangrove losses and improve resistance and resilience to climate change. Coastal planning can adapt to facilitate mangrove migration with sea-level rise. Management of activities within the catchment that affect long-term trends in the mangrove sediment elevation, better management of other stressors on mangroves, rehabilitation of degraded mangrove areas, and increases in systems of strategically designed protected area networks that include mangroves and functionally linked ecosystems through representation, replication and refugia, are additional adaptation options. \textcopyright{} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

This study examines the sensitivity of vegetation model simulations to: (i) the selection of input climatologies representing different time periods and their associated atmospheric CO2, concentrations, (ii) the choice of observed vegetation data for evaluating the model results, and (iii) the methods used to compare simulated and observed vegetation. We use vegetation simulated for Asia by the equilibrium vegetation model BIOME4 as a typical example of vegetation model output. BIOME4 was run using 19 different climatologies and their associated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. The Kappa statistic, Fuzzy Kappa statistic and a newly developed map-comparison method, the Nomad index, were used to quantify the agreement between the biomes simulated under each scenario and the observed vegetation from three different global land- and tree-cover data sets: the global Potential Natural Vegetation data set (PNV), the Global Land Cover Characteristics data set (GLCC), and the Global Land Cover Facility data set (GLCF). The results indicate that the 30-year mean climatology (and its associated atmospheric CO2 concentration) for the time period immediately preceding the collection date of the observed vegetation data produce the most accurate vegetation simulations when compared with all three observed vegetation data sets. The study also indicates that the BIOME4-simulated vegetation for Asia more closely matches the PNV data than the other two observed vegetation data sets. Given the same observed data, the accuracy assessments of the BIOME4 simulations made using the Kappa, Fuzzy Kappa and Nomad index map-comparison methods agree well when the compared vegetation types consist of a large number of spatially continuous grid cells. The results of this analysis can assist model users in designing experimental protocols for simulating vegetation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  volume = {20},
  doi = {10.1111/gcb.12576},
  abstract = {Northern Europe supports large soil organic carbon (SOC) pools and has been subjected to high frequency of land-use changes during the past decades. However, this region has not been well represented in previous large-scale syntheses of land-use change effects on SOC, especially regarding effects of afforestation. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis of SOC stock change following afforestation in Northern Europe. Response ratios were calculated for forest floors and mineral soils (0-10 cm and 0-20/30 cm layers) based on paired control (former land use) and afforested plots. We analyzed the influence of forest age, former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class. Three major improvements were incorporated in the meta-analysis: analysis of major interaction groups, evaluation of the influence of nonindependence between samples according to study design, and mass correction. Former land use was a major factor contributing to changes in SOC after afforestation. In former croplands, SOC change differed between soil layers and was significantly positive (20\%) in the 0-10 cm layer. Afforestation of former grasslands had a small negative (nonsignificant) effect indicating limited SOC change following this land-use change within the region. Forest floors enhanced the positive effects of afforestation on SOC, especially with conifers. Meta-estimates calculated for the periods $<$30 years and $>$30 years since afforestation revealed a shift from initial loss to later gain of SOC. The interaction group analysis indicated that meta-estimates in former land-use, forest type, and soil textural class alone were either offset or enhanced when confounding effects among variable classes were considered. Furthermore, effect sizes were slightly overestimated if sample dependence was not accounted for and if no mass correction was performed. We conclude that significant SOC sequestration in Northern Europe occurs after afforestation of croplands and not grasslands, and changes are small within a 30-year perspective.},

In Europe, urbanization will probably be the main cause of land-use change. This increase in urbanization will result in spatial shifts in both supplies of ecosystem services and the beneficiaries of those services; the net outcome of such shifts remains to be determined. Here, we model changes in urban land cover in Britain based on large (16\%) projected increases in the human population by 2031, and the consequences for three different services--flood mitigation, agricultural production and carbon storage. We show that under a scenario of densification of urban areas, the combined effect of increasing population and loss of permeable surfaces is likely to result in 1.7 million people living within 1 km of rivers with at least 10 per cent increases in projected peak flows, but that increasing suburban 'sprawl' will have little effect on flood mitigation services. Conversely, losses of stored carbon and agricultural production are over three times as high under the sprawl as under the 'densification' urban growth scenarios. Our results illustrate the challenges of meeting, but also of predicting, future demands and patterns of ecosystem services in the face of increasing urbanization.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, soil erosion by water has become a worldwide problem, especially with climate change and progressive declines in the ratio of natural resources to human populations. Changes in future climate will influence soil erosion, particularly suspended sediment (SS) yield, and alter the effectiveness of water resources management strategies from a water quality perspective. We qualitatively assessed future changes in SS yield in Japan. We focused on the impacts of future hydrological changes projected by two models, the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC) and the Meteorological Research Institute Atmospheric General Circulation Model (MRI-GCM), whose results have produced monthly data sets for the whole of Japan. The impacts of future climate changes on SS in Japan depend on the balance between changes in climatic and geologic factors. Methods for assessing impact using the catchment simulator were expanded to estimate the SS yield for the whole of Japan. The results indicated that SS generation will increase by the 2090s, with an 8\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} increase predicted using MRI-GCM data and a 24\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} increase using MIROC data, compared to present-day values measured by the Automated Meteorological Data Acquisition System (AMEDAS) of the Japan Meteorological Agency. Analysis by month showed the largest increases in SS in September, related to the frequency of extreme events such as typhoons. Increased SS can have negative effects on both society and the environment, including reduced crop productivity, worsened water quality, lower effective reservoir water levels, flooding and habitat destruction. Prediction of the impacts of future climate change on SS generation is crucial for effective environmental planning and management. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Time series of satellite data have an important role in the monitoring of regional and global ecosystem properties. Satellite images often present missing data due to atmospheric aerosol, clouds or other atmospheric conditions. Most methods proposed to minimise the effects of degradation and to restore signal values do not take into account the spatial and temporal correlation of the values in the pixels. The aim of this study was to propose and test a spatio-temporal interpolation method to reconstruct pixel values in MODIS data time series that are missing due to cloud cover or other image noise. The method presented and tested is an example of a hybrid Generalised Additive Model (GAM)-geostatistical space-time model, including the fitting of a smoother spatio-temporal trend and a spatial component to account for local details supported by information in covariates. The method is not limited by the type of noise or degradation of pixels values, latitude, vegetation dynamics and land uses. The application of cloud masks on the target image provided the data for a quantitative validation through the comparison between the modelled EVI values and those from the MODIS product. The method was able to restore data providing very good to adequate responses in series of simulations of missing data. The comparison of distributions showed good agreement and predictive capabilities. The spatio-temporal method always performed better and the use of kriged residuals was helpful for situations with high percentages of missing data. The spatial pattern and the local features were well preserved for cloud coverage 20\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\}. For higher percentages of missing data, the results were smoother with less local detail retained, but still showing the general spatial pattern of the variable. The method has proved to be flexible and able to provide reconstructed images reproducing spatial patterns and local features of the measured product, even with substantial amounts of missing pixels. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2012 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Results estimate that livestock consume 6 billion tonnes of feed (dry matter) annually \textendash{} including one third of global cereal production \textendash{} of which 86\% is made of materials that are currently not eaten by humans. In addition, soybean cakes, which production can be considered as main driver or land-use, represent 4\% of the global livestock feed intake. Producing 1kg of boneless meat requires an average of 2.8kg human-edible feed in ruminant systems and 3.2kg in monogastric systems. While livestock is estimated to use 2.5 billion ha of land, modest improvements in feed use efficiency can reduce further expansion.},

  abstract = {Changes in the climate due to anthropogenic effects are impacting the global oceans and the constituent biology, particularly through changes in water temperature. Impacts of warming water on oceanic species are most likely to be detected as changes in distribution. Pelagic fishes, in particular, respond to changes in ocean temperature, and modify their distribution on seasonal and interannual timescales, and thus are likely to do so in the future. Global climate models provide insight into possible future conditions, but there is also considerable uncertainty regarding future changes because of differences in model structure and future scenarios. To address some of this uncertainty, I considered output from multiple climate models through an ensemble analysis and examined potential changes in the distribution of large pelagic fishes captured by longline fisheries on the east and west coast of Australia by the year 2100. For the east coast, over 95\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of model predictions for 14 pelagic species (tunas and billfishes) suggested that core range would move south, and be smaller than what occurs presently. There was less certainty for the west coast, although the core range for all 14 species moved south and was smaller for 63\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} and larger for 37\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of scenario-model combinations. The overall rate of predicted habitat movement for the suite of pelagic species averaged about 40 km/decade. While relatively coarse, these predictions give some confidence to stakeholders about likely changes in future distribution for these regionally important pelagic fishes. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2010.},

  abstract = {Quantifying the impacts of climate change on the hydrology and ecosystem is important in the study of the Loess Plateau, China, which is well known for its high erosion rates and ecosystem sensitivity to global change. A distributed ecohydrological model was developed and applied in the Jinghe River basin of the Loess Plateau. This model couples the vegetation model, BIOME BioGeochemicalCycles (BIOME-BGC) and the distributed hydrological model, Water and Energy transfer Process in Large river basins (WEP-L). The WEP-L model provided hydro-meteorological data to BIOME-BGC, and the vegetation parameters of WEP-L were updated at a daily time step by BIOME-BGC. The model validation results show good agreement with field observation data and literature values of leaf area index (LAI), net primary productivity (NPP) and river discharge. Average climate projections of 23 global climate models (GCMs), based on three emissions scenarios, were used in simulations to assess future ecohydrological responses in the Jinghe River basin. The results show that global warming impacts would decrease annual discharge and flood season discharge, increase annual NPP and decrease annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Increasing evapotranspiration (ET) due to air temperature increase, as well as increases in precipitation and LAI, are the main reasons for the decreasing discharge. The increase in annual NPP is caused by a greater increase in gross primary productivity (GPP) than in plant respiration, whilst the decrease in NEP is caused by a larger increase in heterotrophic respiration than in NPP. Both the air temperature increase and the precipitation increase may affect the changes in NPP and NEP. These results present a serious challenge for water and land management in the basin, where mitigation/adaption measures for climate change are desired. Editor Z.W. Kundzewicz; Associate editor D.

  doi = {10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.09.001},
  abstract = {Environmental change often requires societies to adapt. In some instances, these adaptations can create feedbacks that amplify the change. Alternatively, other adaptations may dampen the change. We used semi-structured interviews with 240 fishers from nine Tanzanian coastal communities to explore responses to four hypothetical scenarios of increasingly severe declines in their average catch (10\%, 20\%, 30\% and 50\%). Overall, a higher proportion of fishers said they would respond to decline using amplifying adaptations (such as fishing harder) than dampening adaptations (such as reducing effort), particularly in the scenarios with lower levels of decline. We used a redundancy analysis to explore whether certain types of responses were related to the fishers' socioeconomic characteristics. Fishers that would employ amplifying responses had greater economic wealth but lacked options. Fishers who would adopt dampening responses possessed characteristics associated with having livelihood options. Fishers who would adopt neither amplifying nor dampening responses were less likely to belong to community groups and sold the largest proportion of their catch. This study provides novel contributions by differentiating aspects of adaptive capacity that will amplify versus dampen environmental change and by highlighting what the resource users' themselves say regarding responding to environmental change. Although direct policy application is limited by the study's hypothetical scenario nature, it provides a good beginning to incorporating resource users' voices into such policy discussions. \textcopyright{} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We predicted the current and potential future occurrence of two migratory herds of caribou \{\{\}\{\{\}\{\}\}[\{\{\}\{\}\}\{\}\}Riviere George herd (RG) and Riviere-aux-Feuilles (RAF) herd] under a Canadian General Circulation Model climate change scenario, across all seasons in the Quebec-Labrador peninsula, using climatic and habitat predictor variables. Argos satellite-tracking collars have been deployed on 213 caribou between 1988 and 2003 with locations recorded every 4-5 days. In addition, we assembled a database of climate (temperature, precipitation, snowfall, timing and length of growing season) and habitat data obtained from the SPOT VEGETATION satellite sensor. Logistic regression models indicated that both climatic and physical habitat variables were significant predictors of current migratory caribou occurrence. Migratory caribou appeared to prefer regions with higher snowfall and lichen availability in the fall and winter. In the summer, caribou preferred cooler areas likely corresponding to a lower prevalence of insects, and they avoided disturbed and recently burnt areas. Climate change projections using climate data predicted an increased range for the RAF herd and decreased range for the RG herd during 2040-2069, limiting the herds to northeastern regions of the Quebec-Labrador peninsula. Direct and indirect consequences of climate change on these migratory caribou herds possibly include alteration in habitat use, migration patterns, foraging behaviour, and demography, in addition to social and economic stress to arctic and subarctic native human populations.},

  doi = {10.1111/geoj.12115},
  abstract = {Nowadays, livestock producers in Sahel have to deal not only with climate variability but also with changes in land use and policies that restrict access to pasture and increase their vulnerability. At the same time, the growth of urban livestock markets both nationwide and in neighbouring countries is creating opportunities for producers. However, few studies have examined the role of markets in the adaptive strategies of livestock producers in West Africa, the changes in strategies for capturing market opportunities and the social interactions that lead to changes in market access and functioning. This paper addresses the question of how livestock producers and traders have transformed their producing and marketing strategies in response to climate variability and land access constraints. Our proposed conceptual framework on markets, vulnerability and adaptation considers that adaptive strategies include the social construction of markets through which market access is based on social networks and follows the norms and rules embedded in the complexity of these networks. This proactive strategy of stakeholders, through a socially constructed market access, allows traders to harness opportunities and livestock producers to adapt to climatic and land access constraints. We apply the framework in a case study in the region of Niono and S\'egou in the Niger Inner delta in Mali. Results show that livestock producers and traders have changed their livestock?raising and marketing strategies in response to the challenges faced by livestock producers and the emerging market opportunities. This study highlights the importance of considering the social construction of livestock market systems and marketing behaviours as adaptive strategies of livestock producers to multiple changes. Although livestock markets can support the adaptive strategies of several types of producers, their functioning as institutions has been understudied and scantily addressed in policy.},

  volume = {7},
  doi = {10.1111/gcbb.12205},
  abstract = {Bioenergy deployment offers significant potential for climate change mitigation, but also carries considerable risks. In this review, we bring together perspectives of various communities involved in the research and regulation of bioenergy deployment in the context of climate change mitigation: Land-use and energy experts, land-use and integrated assessment modelers, human geographers, ecosystem researchers, climate scientists and two different strands of life-cycle assessment experts. We summarize technological options, outline the state-of-the-art knowledge on various climate effects, provide an update on estimates of technical resource potential and comprehensively identify sustainability effects. Cellulosic feedstocks, increased end-use efficiency, improved land carbon-stock management and residue use, and, when fully developed, BECCS appear as the most promising options, depending on development costs, implementation, learning, and risk management. Combined heat and power, efficient biomass cookstoves and small-scale power generation for rural areas can help to promote energy access and sustainable development, along with reduced emissions. We estimate the sustainable technical potential as up to 100EJ: high agreement; 100-300EJ: medium agreement; above 300EJ: low agreement. Stabilization scenarios indicate that bioenergy may supply from 10 to 245EJyr(-1) to global primary energy supply by 2050. Models indicate that, if technological and governance preconditions are met, large-scale deployment ($>$200EJ), together with BECCS, could help to keep global warming below 2 degrees degrees of preindustrial levels; but such high deployment of land-intensive bioenergy feedstocks could also lead to detrimental climate effects, negatively impact ecosystems, biodiversity and livelihoods. The integration of bioenergy systems into agriculture and forest landscapes can improve land and water use efficiency and help address concerns about environmental impacts. We conclude that the high variability in pathways, uncertainties in technological development and ambiguity in political decision render forecasts on deployment levels and climate effects very difficult. However, uncertainty about projections should not preclude pursuing beneficial bioenergy options.},

level by similar to 3.3-5 m. Ice-sheet models and geological data
suggest at least one collapse has happened during the last 1.1 Ma, and
some scenarios of future climate change predict a collapse within the
next two centuries. A complete WAIS collapse would open shallow seaways
across West Antarctica, potentially enabling exchange of animals between
West Antarctic seas. We investigated biological evidence for past
connectivity between different regions of Antarctica by comparing the
composition of modern bryozoan assemblages from the continental margin
around Antarctica. Surprisingly, we found most similarity between two
areas which are not currently connected - the shelves of the Weddell Sea
(WS) and Ross Sea (RS). We evaluated three hypotheses to explain this
and conclude that bryozoans most likely dispersed through a
trans-Antarctic seaway that opened in response to a WAIS collapse and
connected the WS and RS shelves. These bryozoans must have survived
glaciations(s) during subsequent ice ages in refuges, whereas they were
wiped out in most other regions of the Antarctic shelf. After the last
glacial period, bryozoan assemblages could freely disperse between many
of the regions we examined (e.g. Antarctic Peninsula and South Shetland
Islands), which has allowed recolonization of areas in which bryozoans
had been eradicated during the last ice age. For the bryozoans on the WS
and RS shelves to be more similar than those which are in close
proximity means the trans-Antarctic seaway may have been as late as the
last few interglacials. Current rates of warming are exceptional
compared with the near past glacial cycles so our study, the strongest
faunal evidence of WAIS collapse during the recent geological past, thus
supports predictions of a near future WAIS collapse (with considerable
global sea level implications) and resultant future major faunal

  abstract = {Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and a methodology to quantify all major components of the global carbon budget, including their uncertainties, based on the combination of a range of data, algorithms, statistics, and model estimates and their interpretation by a broad scientific community. We discuss changes compared to previous estimates as well as consistency within and among components, alongside methodology and data limitations. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry (E-FF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (E-LUC), mainly deforestation, are based on combined evidence from land-cover-change data, fire activity associated with deforestation, and models. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (G(ATM)) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The mean ocean CO2 sink (S-OCEAN) is based on observations from the 1990s, while the annual anomalies and trends are estimated with ocean models. The variability in S-OCEAN is evaluated with data products based on surveys of ocean CO2 measurements. The global residual terrestrial CO2 sink (S-LAND) is estimated by the difference of the other terms of the global carbon budget and compared to results of independent dynamic global vegetation models forced by observed climate, CO2, and land-cover change (some including nitrogen-carbon interactions). We compare the mean land and ocean fluxes and their variability to estimates from three atmospheric inverse methods for three broad latitude bands. All uncertainties are reported as +/- 1 sigma, reflecting the current capacity to characterise the annual estimates of each component of the global carbon budget. For the last decade available (20052014), E-FF was 9.0 +/- 0.5 GtC yr(-1) E-LUC was 0.9 +/- 0.5 GtC yr(-1), GATM was 4.4 +/- 0.1 GtC yr(-1), S-OCEAN was 2.6 +/- 0.5 GtC yr(-1), and S LAND was 3.0 +/- 0.8 GtC yr(-1). For the year 2014 alone, E FF grew to 9.8 +/- 0.5 GtC yr(-1), 0.6\% above 2013, continuing the growth trend in these emissions, albeit at a slower rate compared to the average growth of 2.2\% yr(-1) that took place during 2005-2014.

  abstract = {In terrestrial ecosystems most carbon (C) occurs below-ground, making the activity of soil decomposer organisms critical to the global carbon cycle. Temperate grassland ecosystems, contain large, diverse and active soil meso- and macrofauna decomposer communities. Understanding the effects of climate change on their ecology offers a first step towards meaningful predictions of changes in soil organic carbon mineralisation. We examined the effects of soil warming on the abundance, diversity and ecology of temperate grassland soil fauna functional groups, ecosystem net CO(2) flux and respiration and plant above- and below-ground productivity in a 2-year plant-soil mesocosm experiment. Low voltage heating cable mounted on a framework of stainless steel mesh provided a constant 3.5 degrees C difference between control and warmed mesocosm soils. Results showed that this temperature increment had little effect on soil respiration and above-ground plant biomass. There was, however, a significant effect on the soil fauna due to warmer conditions and increased root growth, with significant decreases in the numbers in the large oligochaete groups and Prostigmata mites and the re-distribution of enchytraeids to deeper soil layers. Functional groups exhibited individualistic responses to soil warming, with the total disappearance of epigeic species in the case of the ecosystem engineers and an increased diversity of fungivorous mites that, together, produced significant changes in the composition and trophic structure of the fauna community. The observed switch towards a fungal driven food web has important implications for the fate of soil organic carbon in temperate ecosystems subjected to sustained warming. Accordingly, soil biology needs to be properly incorporated in C models to make better predictions of the fate of SOC under warmer scenarios. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Assessing potential future changes in arctic and boreal plant species productivity, ecosystem composition, and canopy complexity is essential for understanding environmental responses under expected altered climate forcing. We examined potential changes in the dominant plant functional types (PFTs) of the sedge tundra, shrub tundra, and boreal forest ecosystems in ecotonal northern Alaska, USA, for the years 2003-2100. We compared energy feedbacks associated with increases in biomass to energy feedbacks associated with changes in the duration of the snow-free season. We based our simulations on nine input climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and a new version of the Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) that incorporates biogeochemistry, vegetation dynamics for multiple PFTs (e.g., trees, shrubs, grasses, sedges, mosses), multiple vegetation pools, and soil thermal regimes. We found mean increases in net primary productivity (NPP) in all PFTs. Most notably, birch (Betula spp.) in the shrub tundra showed increases that were at least three times larger than any other PFT. Increases in NPP were positively related to increases in growing-season length in the sedge tundra, but PFTs in boreal forest and shrub tundra showed a significant response to changes in light availability as well as growing-season length. Significant NPP responses to changes in vegetation uptake of nitrogen by PFT indicated that some PFTs were better competitors for nitrogen than other PFTs. While NPP increased, heterotrophic respiration (RH) also increased, resulting in decreases or no change in net ecosystem carbon uptake. Greater aboveground biomass from increased NPP produced a decrease in summer albedo, greater regional heat absorption (0.34 $\pm$ 0.23 W-m\textasciitilde{}210 yr"1 [mean $\pm$ SD]), and a positive feedback to climate warming. However, the decrease in albedo due to a shorter snow season (-5.1 $\pm$ 1.6 d/10 yr) resulted in much greater regional heat absorption (3.3 $\pm$ 1.24 Wm\textasciitilde{}210 yr"1) than that associated with increases in vegetation. Through quantifying feedbacks associated with changes in vegetation and those associated with changes in the snow season length, we can reach a more integrated understanding of the manner in which climate change may impact interactions between high-latitude ecosystems and the climate system.},

  abstract = {Dietary choices drive both health and environmental outcomes. Information on diets come from many sources, with nationally recommended diets (NRDs) by governmental or similar advisory bodies the most authoritative. Little or no attention is placed on the environmental impacts within NRDs. Here we quantify the impact of nation-specific NRDs, compared with an average diet in 37 nations, representing 64\% of global population. We focus on greenhouse gases (GHGs), eutrophication, and land use because these have impacts reaching or exceeding planetary boundaries. We show that compared with average diets, NRDs in high-income nations are associated with reductions in GHG, eutrophication, and land use from 13.0 to 24.8\%, 9.8 to 21.3\%, and 5.7 to 17.6\%, respectively. In upper-middle-income nations, NRDs are associated with slight decrease in impacts of 0.8-12.2\%, 7.7-19.4\%, and 7.2-18.6\%. In poorer middle-income nations, impacts increase by 12.4-17.0\%, 24.5-31.9\%, and 8.8-14.8\%. The reduced environmental impact in high-income countries is driven by reductions in calories ($\sim$54\% of effect) and a change in composition ($\sim$46\%). The increased environmental impacts of NRDs in low- and middle-income nations are associated with increased intake in animal products. Uniform adoption of NRDs across these nations would result in reductions of 0.19-0.53 Gt CO2 eq$\cdot$a-1, 4.32-10.6 Gt [Formula: see text] eq$\cdot$a-1, and 1.5-2.8 million km2, while providing the health cobenefits of adopting an NRD. As a small number of dietary guidelines are beginning to incorporate more general environmental concerns, we anticipate that this work will provide a standardized baseline for future work to optimize recommended diets further.},

  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd. Anthropogenic land cover changes (LCC) affect regional and global climate through biophysical variations of the surface energy budget mediated by albedo, evapotranspiration, and roughness. This change in surface energy budget may exacerbate or counteract biogeochemical greenhouse gas effects of LCC, with a large body of emerging assessments being produced, sometimes apparently contradictory. We reviewed the existing scientific literature with the objective to provide an overview of the state-of-the-knowledge of the biophysical LCC climate effects, in support of the assessment of mitigation/adaptation land policies. Out of the published studies that were analyzed, 28 papers fulfilled the eligibility criteria, providing surface air temperature and/or precipitation change with respect to LCC regionally and/or globally. We provide a synthesis of the signal, magnitude and uncertainty of temperature and precipitation changes in response to LCC biophysical effects by climate region (boreal/temperate/tropical) and by key land cover transitions. Model results indicate that a modification of biophysical processes at the land surface has a strong regional climate effect, and non-negligible global impact on temperature. Simulations experiments of large-scale (i.e. complete) regional deforestation lead to a mean reduction in precipitation in all regions, while air surface temperature increases in the tropics and decreases in boreal regions. The net global climate effects of regional deforestation are less certain. There is an overall consensus in the model experiments that the average global biophysical climate response to complete global deforestation is atmospheric cooling and drying. Observed estimates of temperature change following deforestation indicate a smaller effect than model-based regional estimates in boreal regions, comparable results in the tropics, and contrasting results in temperate regions. Regional/local biophysical effects following LCC are important for local climate, water cycle, ecosystems, their productivity and biodiversity, and thus important to consider in the formulation of adaptation policy. However before considering the inclusion of biophysical climate effects of LCC under the UNFCCC, science has to provide robust tools and methods for estimation of both country and global level effects.},

  abstract = {Here, global-scale frozen ground distribution from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) has been reconstructed using multi-model ensembles of global climate models, and then compared with evidence-based knowledge and earlier numerical results. Modeled soil temperatures, taken from Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project phase III (PMIP3) simulations, were used to diagnose the subsurface thermal regime and determine underlying frozen ground types for the present day (pre-industrial; 0 kya) and the LGM (21 kya). This direct method was then compared to an earlier indirect method, which categorizes underlying frozen ground type from surface air temperature, applying to both the PMIP2 (phase II) and PMIP3 products. Both direct and indirect diagnoses for 0 kya showed strong agreement with the present-day observation-based map. The soil temperature ensemble showed a higher diversity around the border between permafrost and seasonally frozen ground among the models, partly due to varying subsurface processes, implementation, and settings. The area of continuous permafrost estimated by the PMIP3 multi-model analysis through the direct (indirect) method was 26.0 (17.7) million km2 for LGM, in contrast to 15.1 (11.2) million km2 for the pre-industrial control, whereas seasonally frozen ground decreased from 34.5 (26.6) million km2 to 18.1 (16.0) million km2. These changes in area resulted mainly from a cooler climate at LGM, but from other factors as well, such as the presence of huge land ice sheets and the consequent expansion of total land area due to sea-level change. LGM permafrost boundaries modeled by the PMIP3 ensemble - improved over those of the PMIP2 due to higher spatial resolutions and improved climatology - also compared better to previous knowledge derived from geomorphological and geocryological evidence. Combinatorial applications of coupled climate models and detailed stand-alone physical-ecological models for the cold-region terrestrial, paleo-, and modern climates will advance our understanding of the functionality and variability of the frozen ground subsystem in the global eco-climate system. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} Author(s) 2013.

  abstract = {Sea-level rise (SLR) from global warming may have severe consequences for biodiversity; however, a baseline, broad-scale assessment of the potential consequences of SLR for island biodiversity is lacking. Here, we quantify area loss for over 12 900 islands and over 3000 terrestrial vertebrates in the Pacific and Southeast Asia under three different SLR scenarios (1 m, 3 m and 6 m). We used very fine-grained elevation information, which offered $>$100 times greater spatial detail than previous analyses and allowed us to evaluate thousands of hitherto not assessed small islands. Depending on the SLR scenario, we estimate that 15-62\% of islands in our study region will be completely inundated and 19-24\% will lose 50-99\% of their area. Overall, we project that between 1\% and 9\% of the total island area in our study region may be lost. We find that Pacific species are 2-3 times more vulnerable than those in the Indomalayan or Australasian region and risk losing 4-22\% of range area (1-6 m SLR). Species already listed as threatened by IUCN are particularly vulnerable compared with non-threatened species. Under a simple area loss-species loss proportionality assumption, we estimate that 37 island group endemic species in this region risk complete inundation of their current global distribution in the 1 m SLR scenario that is widely anticipated for this century (and 118 species under 3 m SLR). Our analysis provides a first, broad-scale estimate of the potential consequences of SLR for island biodiversity and our findings confirm that islands are extremely vulnerable to sea-level rise even within this century.},

  abstract = {Global changes have the potential to cause a mass extinction. Predicting how species will respond to anticipated changes is a necessary prerequisite to effectively conserving them and reducing extinction rates. Species niche models are widely used for such predictions, but their reliability over long time periods is known to vary. However, climate and land use changes in northern countries provide a pseudo-experiment to test model reliability for predicting future conditions, provided historical data on both species distributions and environmental conditions are available. Using maximum entropy, a prominent modeling technique, we constructed historical models of butterfly species' ranges across Canada and then ran the models forward to present-day to test how well they predicted the current ranges of species. For the majority of species, projections of how we predicted species would respond to known climate changes corresponded with species' observed responses (mean autoregressive R-2 = 0.70). This correspondence declined for northerly and very widely distributed species. Our results demonstrate that at least some species are tracking shifting climatic conditions across very large geographic areas and that these shifts can be predicted accurately using niche models. We also found, however, that models for some species fail when projected through time despite high spatial model accuracies during model training, highlighting the need to base management decisions on species assemblages, not individual species.},

  abstract = {The nexus of population growth and changing diets has increased the demands placed on agriculture to supply food for human consumption, animal feed and fuel. Rising incomes lead to dietary changes, from staple crops, towards commodities with greater land requirements, e.g. meat and dairy products. Despite yield improvements partially offsetting increases in demand, agricultural land has still been expanding, causing potential harm to ecosystems, e.g. through deforestation. We use country-level panel data (1961-2011) to allocate the land areas used to produce food for human consumption, waste and biofuels, and to attribute the food production area changes to diet, population and yields drivers. The results show that the production of animal products dominates agricultural land use and land use change over the 50-year period, accounting for 65\% of land use change. The rate of extensification of animal production was found to have reduced more recently, principally due to the smaller effect of population growth. The area used for bioenergy was shown to be relatively small, but formed a substantial contribution (36\%) to net agricultural expansion in the most recent period. Nevertheless, in comparison to dietary shifts in animal products, bioenergy accounted for less than a tenth of the increase in demand for agricultural land. Population expansion has been the largest driver for agricultural land use change, but dietary changes are a significant and growing driver. China was a notable exception, where dietary transitions dominate food consumption changes, due to rapidly rising incomes. This suggests that future dietary changes will become the principal driver for land use change, pointing to the potential need for demand-side measures to regulate agricultural expansion.},

  abstract = {Supplying food for the anticipated global population of over 9 billion in 2050 under changing climate conditions is one of the major challenges of the 21st century. Agricultural expansion and intensification contributes to global environmental change and risks the long-term sustainability of the planet. It has been proposed that no more than 15\% of the global ice-free land surface should be converted to cropland. Bioenergy production for land-based climate mitigation places additional pressure on limited land resources. Here we test normative targets of food supply and bioenergy production within the cropland planetary boundary using a global land-use model. The results suggest supplying the global population with adequate food is possible without cropland expansion exceeding the planetary boundary. Yet this requires an increase in food production, especially in developing countries, as well as a decrease in global crop yield gaps. However, under current assumptions of future food requirements, it was not possible to also produce significant amounts of first generation bioenergy without cropland expansion. These results suggest that meeting food and bioenergy demands within the planetary boundaries would need a shift away from current trends, for example, requiring major change in the demand-side of the food system or advancing biotechnologies.},

We coupled output from a hydrodynamics model of lake thermal structure to a bioenergetics model to assess how alternative scenarios of climate change, geomorphic evolution and habitat restoration in a shallow Alaskan lake may affect juvenile sockeye salmon bioenergetics and growth. In particular, we evaluated the metabolic costs of different thermal regimes and the potential for changes in consumption to offset those costs. Increased water temperatures associated with future climate increased metabolic costs which were partially offset if fish were able to maintain feeding rates, expressed as a constant proportion of maximum consumption. In this lake, water levels have declined substantially in the last 50 years. Simulated restored lake level had negligible effects on lake temperature and thus on sockeye salmon growth when compared to current conditions. Maintaining lake connectivity to inlet tributaries (cooling lake temperature) was crucial in reducing sockeye salmon metabolic costs particularly with further drops in lake level and climate warming. While considerable research is focused on predicting future thermal and geomorphic conditions in aquatic ecosystems, these processes are rarely considered together, especially for lakes. Understanding the biological responses to geomorphicclimate interactions will be required for developing scenarios for coping with ecosystem responses to global change and evaluating restoration alternatives, especially in high-latitude systems that support economically and culturally important fisheries.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.ecoleng.2015.05.013},
  abstract = {Climate change is expected to alter temperature and precipitation patterns and thereby river discharges. As floodplain vegetation types in Central Europe are mainly structured by the local hydrologic conditions of the river, alterations in the flow regime should lead to changes in the structure of floodplain communities, too. However, much uncertainty about potential hydrologic changes exists due to the variability in modeled discharges by different global and regional climate models. Aim of our study was to assess potential changes and their uncertainty in the future habitat availability of plant species representing characteristic floodplain vegetation types along the Rhine River. Therefore, habitat distribution models for 29 different species were calculated relating species distribution to local hydrologic conditions. Habitat changes were assessed by comparing future habitat availability of five different climate change projections with reference state conditions for four stretches along the Rhine for two different future periods. Models revealed that besides different water level parameters also water level variability was decisive for habitat distribution patterns. Relative habitat changes showed large variation for the different species between and within vegetation types, as well as for the different river stretches and future periods. However, intersection of the five projections displayed large overlap regarding future habitat availability for many of the species. Moreover, a tendency of the different vegetation types to occur on higher elevated sites was found. Our study emphasizes the necessity to consider the variability of different climate change projections to reasonably assess potential changes in habitat availability of floodplain vegetation and provides a tool to identify species groups and river sections vulnerable to climate change induced hydrologic alterations. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Transformability is the capacity to cross thresholds into new development trajectories. Transformational change at smaller scales enables resilience at larger scales.

With human reliance on TGBs increasing and their propensity for change, ecological and evolutionary understanding of these biomes is central to the dual goals of sustaining their ecological integrity and the diverse services these landscapes provide to millions of people.

  abstract = {Many studies now identify the impacts of global climate change as a conservation threat to terrestrial ecosystems. In West Virginia, red spruce (Picea rubens) forests are a rare forest community of great ecological value, occurring in 'island-like' distributions among higher elevations. In this study, 168 red spruce presence localities and 24 environmental and site-specific variables were used to model red spruce habitat using select climate change scenarios. Maximum entropy models were created for aggressive and conservative climate change scenarios, with each scenario model performed for three time periods (i.e., 2020, 2050, and 2080). Results for both model analyses identified three variables which contributed significantly to model performance: mean temperature of the coldest quarter of the year, elevation, and minimum temperature of the coldest month of the year. Changes in suitable habitat area were also assessed for both model scenarios at each time period examined. Approximately 6.2\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} of the land area in West Virginia was modeled under current habitat conditions as suitable red spruce habitat. However, by the time period 2020, a loss of 78\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} and 52\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} was identified for the aggressive and conservative climate change models, respectively. By the time period 2080, no suitable red spruce habitat was modeled using the aggressive climate change scenario with an 85\{\{\}\{\%\}\{\}\} reduction in current modeled habitat identified using the conservative model. These findings indicate the potential impacts of climate change on red spruce forest habitat in West Virginia and provide valuable guidance for future restoration efforts by identifying areas most likely to succeed under altered climatic conditions. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2015 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.},

  abstract = {Recently, ecological niche models have been employed to investigate the potential geographical distribution of species. However, it is necessary to analyze the vast number of publications on this topic to understand the trends and biases of research using ecological niche models (\{ENMs\}). Therefore, this study aims to investigate trends in the scientific literature regarding studies on \{ENMs\}. For the quantitative analysis of the literature on \{ENMs\}, we performed a search in the Thomson \{ISI\} (Web of Science) database between 1991 and 2013. The search identified 3042 papers containing preselected keywords in either the title or abstract. The results showed that the number of papers has increased over the years (r=0.77, P\{$\backslash$textbackslash\}backslashtextless0.001), with a sharp increase in recent years, highlighting the widespread use of the \{ENMs\}. There was an increase in the diversity of journals that published papers about \{ENMs\} (r=0.97, P\{$\backslash$textbackslash\}backslashtextless0.001). The research was conducted in different countries, predominantly the United States of America (550 papers), and the most commonly used method was the Maximum Entropy method (312 papers). Regarding the taxonomic group, most research has been conducted on plants (402 papers, or 28.36\% of the total). There was no relationship between the modeling method used and the taxonomic group studied (\$$\chi$\$2=4.8, P=0.15). Finally, the wide availability of biological, environmental and computational resources has elicited the broad use of tools for \{ENMs\}. Despite the conceptual discussions of the \{ENMs\}, this method is currently the most effective way to evaluate the potential geographical distribution of species, and to predict the distribution under different environmental conditions (i.e., future or past scenarios). \textcopyright{} 2015, Instituto Internacional de Ecologia.

  title = {A Synthesis of Change in Deep Soil Organic Carbon Stores with Afforestation of Agricultural Soils},
  volume = {296},
  doi = {10.1016/j.foreco.2013.01.026},
  abstract = {Afforestation is known as an available mitigation activity to climate change because it causes sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere and stores it as the living biomass and the dead organic matter. However, the response of soil organic carbon (SOC) to afforestation in deep soil layers is still poorly understood. We surveyed previously published literature for changes in deep SOC (defined as at least 10 cm deeper than the 0-10 cm layer) after afforestation of croplands and grasslands (total 63 sites from 56 literature), in order to examine changes in deep SOC and quantify the relationship between SOC change rates in topsoil and subsoil. The results of the meta analysis indicated that the responses of SOC to afforestation were opposite for cropland than grassland. The SOC in soil depth layers of 0-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60 and 60-80 cm were reduced with afforestation of grassland but not significantly (p $>$ 0.05), while conversion of cropland to forests (trees or shrubs) increased SOC significantly for each soil depth layer up to 60 cm depth (p $<$ 0.05). Significant relationships of SOC change rate were found between topsoil (0-20 cm) and deeper soil layers (20-40 and 40-60 cm). The linear regression showed that SOC change rate in 0-40 cm, 0-60 cm, and 0-100 cm soil profiles was 1.33, 1.49, and 1.55 times greater, respectively than the change rates in the corresponding 0-20 cm depth profile. Partial correlation analysis revealed that stand age and initial SOC content were determinants of deep soil SOC change after afforestation of agricultural soils. This study also showed that the O horizon can play an important role in carbon sequestration after afforestation of agricultural sites. We concluded that subsoil carbon must be taken into account when evaluating of SOC change with afforestation and, therefore, recommended that the soil sampling depth for afforested soils be set to at least 60 cm in mineral soils and include the O horizon. However, due to poor study designs and lack of standardized sampling protocols in the literature, these results were high in uncertainty. Crown Copyright (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

  volume = {7},
  doi = {10.1186/1754-6834-7-93},
  abstract = {Background: In order to rapidly and efficiently screen potential biofuel feedstock candidates for quintessential traits, robust high-throughput analytical techniques must be developed and honed. The traditional methods of measuring lignin syringyl/guaiacyl (S/G) ratio can be laborious, involve hazardous reagents, and/or be destructive. Vibrational spectroscopy can furnish high-throughput instrumentation without the limitations of the traditional techniques. Spectral data from mid-infrared, near-infrared, and Raman spectroscopies was combined with S/G ratios, obtained using pyrolysis molecular beam mass spectrometry, from 245 different eucalypt and Acacia trees across 17 species. Iterations of spectral processing allowed the assembly of robust predictive models using partial least squares (PLS). Results: The PLS models were rigorously evaluated using three different randomly generated calibration and validation sets for each spectral processing approach. Root mean standard errors of prediction for validation sets were lowest for models comprised of Raman (0.13 to 0.16) and mid-infrared (0.13 to 0.15) spectral data, while near-infrared spectroscopy led to more erroneous predictions (0.18 to 0.21). Correlation coefficients (r) for the validation sets followed a similar pattern: Raman (0.89 to 0.91), mid-infrared (0.87 to 0.91), and near-infrared (0.79 to 0.82). These statistics signify that Raman and mid-infrared spectroscopy led to the most accurate predictions of S/G ratio in a diverse consortium of feedstocks. Conclusion: Eucalypts present an attractive option for biofuel and biochemical production. Given the assortment of over 900 different species of Eucalyptus and Corymbia, in addition to various species of Acacia, it is necessary to isolate those possessing ideal biofuel traits. This research has demonstrated the validity of vibrational spectroscopy to efficiently partition different potential biofuel feedstocks according to lignin S/G ratio, significantly reducing experiment and analysis time and expense while providing non-destructive, accurate, global, predictive models encompassing a diverse array of feedstocks. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2014 Lupoi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  doi = {10.5846/stxb201101150081},
  abstract = {Increasing atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is one of the hot topics related to global climate change. This change has altered soil N availability and is expected to affect plant N economy. For terrestrial ecosystems where N is a limiting factor, increased N deposition may lead to a shift from N limitation to P limitation, possibly resulting in changes in plant P use strategies. Research into nutrient conservation responses to increased N gradients is important in exploring the effects of global climate change on the nutrient economy of plants and thus on ecosystem-level nutrient cycling. We studied the responses of several leaf traits in relation to nutrient conservation strategies, including specific leaf area (SLA), N and P concentrations in green leaves, and N and P concentrations in senescing leaves. Our objective was to investigate the potential effects of increased N deposition on N and P use strategies for dominant species of temperate grasslands. This study was conducted during 2003-2006 and compared plant responses to N levels of 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 g/m 2. Five temperate grassland species of Inner Mongolia belonging to three different life-forms were studied: Stipa krylovii Roshev. (grass), Cleistogenes squarrosa (Trin.) Keng. (grass), Artemisia frigida Willd. (semishrub), Potentilla acaulis L. (forb) and Allium bidentatum Fischer ex Prokhanov \{\{\}\{\&\}\{\}\} Ikonnikov-Galitzky (forb). The results show SLAs in A. frigida, P. acaulis and A. bidentatum increased with increasing N availability while no obvious trends were found in the two grasses. N concentrations in green leaves of the five species increased significantly, while the P concentration change in green leaves were species-specific. The P concentration in A. bidentatum initially decreased but increased with higher N levels. The other four species showed insignificant relationships with N addition gradients. In senescing leaves, N concentrations increased significantly for all five species. The response of P concentration to increasing N availability in senescing leaves was also species-specific. P concentrations in A. frigida, P. acaulis and C. squarrosa initially increased and then decreased at high N levels; however, no obvious trends were found in S. krylovii and A. bidentatum. The SLA and nutrient concentrations in A. frigida were higher than the other species but they were lower in the two grasses. These results offer basic data useful in forecasting the potential influences of increasing N deposition and associated changes in P availability on ecosystem nutrient cycling in the temperate grasslands of Inner Mongolia. The generally increasing trends in green leaf SLA and increasing N concentrations in both green and senescing leaves indicate an increase in N deposition enhances N uptake for these species but decreases N reabsorption, therefore decreasing the ability of plants to conserve N. In contrast, the effect of increased N deposition on P use strategy is species-specific, reflecting the flexible adaptation of P strategy of plants in relation to changes in N availability. Consequently, increased N deposition changes a plant${'}$s N and P use strategies, which causes further changes in N and P cycling in plant-soil systems. These species-specific responses will strongly influence community structure.},

  abstract = {Soil erosion not only results in severe ecological damage, but also interferes with soil organic carbon formation and decomposition, influencing the global green-house effect. However, there is controversy as to whether a typical small watershed presumed as the basic unit of sediment yield acts as a CO 2 sink or source. This paper proposes a discriminant equation for the direction of CO 2 flux in small watersheds, basing on the concept of Sediment Delivery Ratio (SDR). Using this equation, watersheds can be classified as Sink Watersheds, Source Watersheds, or Transition Watersheds, noting that small watersheds can act either as a CO 2 sink or as a CO 2 source. A mathematical model for calculating the two discriminant coefficients in the equation is set up to analyze the conditions under which each type of watershed would occur. After assigning the model parameter values at three levels (low, medium, and high), and considering 486 scenarios in total, the influences are examined for turnover rate of the carbon pool, erosion rate, deposition rate, cultivation depth and period. The effect of adopting conservation measures like residue return, contour farming, terracing, and conservation tillage is also analyzed. The results show that Sink Watersheds are more likely to result in conditions of high erosion rate, long cultivation period, high deposition rate, fast carbon pool turnover rate, and small depth of cultivation; otherwise, Source Watersheds would possibly occur. The results also indicate that residue return and conservation tillage are beneficial for CO 2 sequestration. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Over two decades of development, a wide variety of model structures and mechanisms have been designed and incorporated into global fire models, which have been linked to different vegetation models. However, there has not yet been a systematic examination of how these different strategies contribute to model performance. Here we describe the structure of the first phase of the Fire Model Intercomparison Project (FireMIP), which for the first time seeks to systematically compare a number of models. By combining a standardized set of input data and model experiments with a rigorous comparison of model outputs to each other and to observations, we will improve the understanding of what drives vegetation fire, how it can best be simulated, and what new or improved observational data could allow better constraints on model behavior. Here we introduce the fire models used in the first phase of FireMIP, the simulation protocols applied, and the benchmarking system used to evaluate the models.$<$/p$>$},

  abstract = {Future runoff projections derived from different global climate models (GCMs) show large differences. Therefore, within this study the, information from multiple GCMs has been combined to better assess hydrological changes. For projections of precipitation and temperature the Reliability ensemble averaging (REA) method was introduced to calculate weighted average ensemble change with an accompanying uncertainty range. In this study the original REA method is compared with three other methods that calculate runoff change by selecting or weighting GCMs on their inter-model similarity for the current and future climate. All methods are applied to distributed runoff fields calculated with the hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB forced with meteorological data from an ensemble of 12 GCMs.Differences between weighted and non-weighted average runoff changes for 2100 are small. Within a validation experiment, where GCM ensemble mean change is derived between the time-slices 1961-1975 and 1976-1990, the non-weighted ensemble change resembled observed change best. Yet, both the weighted and non-weighted average change were too conservative. This underscores the importance of considering an uncertainty range alongside the ensemble average change. In this study the uncertainty range (or 95\% confidence interval) is defined by four times the root mean square difference around the ensemble mean change. The uncertainty range derived with the non-weighted method is relatively wide, upper and lower uncertainty bounds show large biases from observed change. However, the uncertainty range was reliably be reduced by using only a selection of GCMs which show high inter-model similarity for the current and future climate. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

We synthesized a novel global dataset of forest CO2-fluxes to evaluate the consistency between EC and biometric or chamber methods for quantifying the CO2budget in forest ecosystems. The EC approach, compared with the other two methods, overestimated net ecosystem production (NEP) by 25\% (0.52 Mg C ha-1 yr-1), and underestimated ecosystem respiration (Re) by 10\% (1.39 Mg C ha-1 yr-1) and gross primary production by 3\% (0.48 Mg C ha-1 yr-1). The differences between EC and the other methods were greater at the sites with complex topography and dense canopy than at the sites with flat topography and open canopy. Forest age also influenced the differences mainly through changes in leaf area index. Open-path EC system induced large positive bias in the NEP estimated by EC, presumably due to its surface-heating effect. These results suggest that EC method likely produce biased estimates of NEP and Re in forest ecosystems. A global extrapolation suggests that the differences in the forest CO2-fluxes measured with different methods be consistent with the global overestimation of NEP and underestimation of Re by EC method. Accounting for these differences would substantially improve our estimates of the forest carbon budget. The uncertainties involved in each method were also discussed. To reduce uncertainty in quantifying both local and global carbon budgets, we recommend cross-validation of forest CO2-fluxes measured by different methods with more accurate measurements and careful data processing strategies.},

Implementing and monitoring forest and landscape restoration requires additional approaches to defining and assessing forests that reveal the qualities and trajectories of forest patches in a spatially and temporally dynamic landscape matrix. New technologies and participatory assessment of forest states and trajectories offer the potential to operationalize such definitions. Purpose-built and contextualized definitions are needed to support policies that successfully protect, sustain, and regrow forests at national and global scales.

  abstract = {Urbanization contributes to the loss of the world's biodiversity and the homogenization of its biota. However, comparative studies of urban biodiversity leading to robust generalities of the status and drivers of biodiversity in cities at the global scale are lacking. Here, we compiled the largest global dataset to date of two diverse taxa in cities: birds (54 cities) and plants (110 cities). We found that the majority of urban bird and plant species are native in the world's cities. Few plants and birds are cosmopolitan, the most common being Columba livia and Poa annua. The density of bird and plant species (the number of species per km(2)) has declined substantially: only 8\% of native bird and 25\% of native plant species are currently present compared with estimates of non-urban density of species. The current density of species in cities and the loss in density of species was best explained by anthropogenic features (landcover, city age) rather than by non-anthropogenic factors (geography, climate, topography). As urbanization continues to expand, efforts directed towards the conservation of intact vegetation within urban landscapes could support higher concentrations of both bird and plant species. Despite declines in the density of species, cities still retain endemic native species, thus providing opportunities for regional and global biodiversity conservation, restoration and education.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on the comparison of wasteto- energy processes in terms of life cycle analysis. The processes compared are the municipal solid waste (MSW) direct combustion (known as mass burning) and the combustion of refused derived fuel (RDF) produced after separation of recyclable materials in a mechanical--biological treatment (MBT) facility. The basis of comparison for the two processes in this paper is their global warming potential (GWP). In specific, three European countries (Greece, Germany and France) were chosen as case studies. Their selection was based on their electricity mix characteristics and the general population culture toward waste management practices, as depicted in the waste composition. The waste composition applied for each country is the average estimated by local statistics and Eurostat data. The comparison between the two methods of incineration leads to the conclusion that the incineration of RDF has less impact on the greenhouse effect than the incineration of MSW. A sensitivity analysis based on different setup configurations for paper and plastic separation in the MBT plant was carried out. The results validate the priorities of waste management hierarchy, since the scenarios with high separation of valuable materials, such as paper and plastics, were environmentally friendlier in terms of GWP impact. The sensitivity analysis based on the change of the recovering rate shows an approximately linear relation of inverse proportion between recovering rate and total environmental impact. Furthermore, the increase in electricity efficiency plays a significant role in the greenhouse effect for the Greek scenario, while its respective effectiveness for the French scenario is lower. Since the final choice between the two processes relies solely upon the needs that should be met on specific occasions, the modeling has been carried out through life cycle analysis principles, in order to provide a decision-making tool for the selection of the most appropriate waste-to-energy technology according to the criteria that be set. \{\{\}\{\textcopyright\}\{\}\} Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2015.},
